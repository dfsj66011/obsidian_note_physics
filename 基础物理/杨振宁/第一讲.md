各位同学，我很高兴有机会跟大家讲一学期的大一物理。我在八十年代、九十年代在美国 Stony Brook 大学（石溪大学）也教过两次大一物理。 我猜想，你们的成绩会比 Stony Brook 的学生好的多，所以你们得当心，因为我预备教完了以后写一篇文章，讨论 Stony Brook 的学生跟清华的学生的对比。 所以你们，也可以说，对于清华的名誉负一点责任。

我自己，我刚才算了下，是六十六年以前在昆明，念过大一物理，那个可以说是我第一次接触到物理学。那么我希望在这一学期里头，大家不单学到一些物理，还学到一些微积分。这个微积分，我要你们特别注意的是，这本教科书 Halliday, Resnick, Walker 的 Appendix E。这个 Appendix E 里面所讨论的一些公式，我希望你们，假如你们已经念过微积分，你就复习一下。假如你们没有念过微积分，你要注意那些公式。

#### 如何学习英文

But I also want you to learn some English. I understand some of you would be able to understand my English, but others may have some difficulties. I hope by speaking slowly you could understand most of what I say.（但我也希望你们能学一些英语。我知道你们中有些人能听懂我说的英语，但其他人可能会有一些困难。我希望通过放慢语速，你们能听懂我说的大部分内容。）

But I want also to tell you a very good method to learn English. To learn English, you have to learn how to listen, how to read, how to speak, and how to write. Although those are very different, but there is one thing which ties them together, and that is your own pronunciation.（但我也想告诉你一个学习英语的好方法。要学好英语，你必须学会如何听、读、说以及如何写。虽然这些方面各不相同，但有一点将它们联系在一起，那就是你自己的发音。）

For a Chinese student at the beginning, there is a tendency to be very much afraid to speak, because the Chinese pronunciation and English pronunciation are very different. The Chinese language emphasizes the muscular movement of the mouth in the front, like the lips, the teeth, the tongue. In English, the main part of the vocal organs are more backwards, so you have to learn to move the center of attention when you speak from the front of the mouth to the back of the mouth.（对于刚开始学习英语的中国学生来说，他们往往非常害怕开口说英语，因为汉语发音和英语发音有很大不同。汉语强调口腔前部的肌肉运动，比如嘴唇、牙齿和舌头。而在英语中，发音器官的主要部位更靠后，因此你必须学会将注意力从口腔前部转移到后部。）

And how do you do that? There is no better way than to read aloud. So I want every one of you to spend maybe three or four minutes every day and read aloud. If you practice that for, let's say, for a month, I can guarantee your English would improve.Because, for example, English grammar has many peculiar features which are not understandable to a Chinese student. （那你该怎么做呢？最好的方法莫过于大声朗读。所以我希望你们每个人每天花上三四分钟，大声朗读。如果你坚持练习一个月，我敢保证你的英语一定会进步。因为，例如，英语语法有许多对中国学生来说难以理解的独特特点。）

我刚念英文的时候，觉得很奇怪，I am, you are, he is. 为什么要更改，那么，为什么要第三人称，为什么多数要加 s，这个，我当初念的时候，最初觉得这个很不自然，觉得中国的这个是比较自然的，可是后来我懂了，它这个，所以有这些加 s，有些 inclination，它的原因是与发音有关系的。所以你如果发音发的好的话，很多文法上的问题，you will understand naturally，Therefore, to try to pronounce things correctly and aloud is very important. （你自然会明白，因此，尝试正确且大声地发音是非常重要的。）

For example, you have in front of you this handout. Everybody has that. On the first page is an appendix. I am going to add to this dictionary later.（例如，你面前有这份讲义。每个人都有。第一页是附录。我稍后会在这个词典里添加内容。）

But if you turn to the next page, the next few pages are from Feynman's book. So I'll give you an example. If you look at the first paragraph of this handout from Feynman, it's a very short paragraph.You can spend two minutes in the morning reading it aloud. In fact, preferably in front of a mirror because then you can watch yourself. If you have a recorder, record it.After one month, you would realize, after one month of this practice, if you listen to what you had recorded a month ago, you would realize that you have improved. So this is an important thing. I want you to do this.（但如果你翻到下一页，接下来的几页内容来自费曼的书。我来举个例子。如果你看这份费曼讲义的第一段，那是一个非常简短的段落。你可以在早上花两分钟大声朗读。实际上，最好站在镜子前，因为这样你可以观察自己。如果有录音机，就录下来。一个月后，你会意识到，经过一个月的这种练习，如果你听一个月前录制的录音，你会发现自己进步了。所以这是一件重要的事情。我希望你这样做。）

In the latter pages, no it's not in there, it's in the Almer web, there is a syllabus. And you should download that syllabus and read that. That is what we are going to discuss in class.（在后面的几页里，不，那里没有，是在 Almer 网站上，有一份教学大纲。你应该下载那份教学大纲并阅读它。那就是我们课堂上要讨论的内容。）

### 第一章：单位

*注：教材是 Fundamentals of Physics（Jearl Walker、Halliday & Resnick） 目前最新是 12th 版*

Now we go to chapter one of the book, Halliday and Resnick, etc, etc. The chapter is very simple. It talks about units.（现在我们进入本书的第一章，由 Halliday 和 Resnick 等人撰写。这一章非常简单，讲的是单位。）

#### 链式法则

And I want you to learn the chain-link rule. Every physical quantity has a dimension, it has a unit, except for numbers, for pure numbers. So if I say something is one meter long, it is not one, it is one meter.（我希望你学会*链式法则*。除了数字，每个物理量都有量纲和单位，纯数字没有。所以如果我说某物长 1 米，它不是数字 1，而是 1 米。）

So remember that the physical quantities have a dimension, it has a unit behind it. And the unit can be, you can calculate with the units to give you an example. If you are asked how many seconds is there in one year, of course I am sure you know this immediately, but I want you to do it in the following way, because that tells you how you can calculate with the units as if the units is a number.（请记住，物理量都有其量纲，背后对应着单位。你可以通过单位运算来理解这一点，举个例子：如果有人问你一年有多少秒，我相信你立刻就能回答出来，但我希望你能用以下方式计算，因为这能让你明白如何像对待数字一样对单位进行运算。）

$$1\, \text{year} = \frac{1\, \text{year}}{\text{days}} \times \frac{\text{days}}{\text{hours}} \times \frac{\text{hours}}{\text{minitus}} \times \frac{\text{mininus}}{\text{seconds}} \times \text{seconds}$$

So you would write one year is equal to one year divided by days. But once you have written that, you have to do this. This is correct, because these days would cancel each other.But you can write the days divided by hours. You have to write this again. So these hours cancel each other, the days cancel each other, so it is an identity.（所以你会写一年等于一年除以天数。但一旦你写下了这个，你就必须这样做。这是正确的，因为这些天数会相互抵消。但你可以把天数按小时划分。你必须再写一遍。这样小时数相互抵消，天数也相互抵消，所以这是一个恒等式。）

But you can have hours, you can have minutes, and you can write seconds, and write seconds. It is important that if you treat these units as if they were numbers, they cancel out correctly. Now you immediately know, this one year divided by days is 365, days divided by hours is 24, hours divided by minutes is 60, minutes divided by seconds is 60, and you still have the second here.（但你可以用小时、分钟来表示时间，甚至可以精确到秒。关键在于，如果你把这些时间单位当作数字来处理，它们必须能够正确约分。现在你马上就能明白：一年除以天数是 365，天数除以小时是 24，小时除以分钟是 60，分钟除以秒也是 60——最终剩下的单位依然是秒。）

So now you know how many seconds. This is of course trivial, but what I want you to learn is that you must treat the units correctly, so that I think this explains to you how you treat the units correctly. And when you get to complicated problems in physics, you have to remember this rule.(所以现在你知道有多少秒了。这当然很简单，但我想让你学会的是必须正确处理单位，所以我认为这向你解释了如何正确处理单位。当你遇到物理学中的复杂问题时，你必须记住这个规则。)

#### 国际单位制 MKS

We are going to adopt the MKS system. MKS means meter, kilogram, second. When I was a freshman student, the internationally adopted system was called CGS. That is centimeter, gram, second, which is of course deeply related to the MKS system. But something like 30 years ago or so, internationally, everybody now adopts the CGS system, the MKS system. (我们将采用 MKS 单位制。MKS 代表米（meter）、千克（kilogram）、秒（second）。我读大一的时候，国际通用的单位制还是 CGS 制，即厘米（centimeter）、克（gram）、秒（second），这当然与 MKS 制有深刻关联。但大约 30 年前开始，国际上普遍改用现在的 MKS 制)

#### 有效数字

An important concept that you must remember is significant figures. This concept is extremely important for physicists and for all scientists. Namely, if I write 3.05, I want you to understand that that is not equal to 3.0500.(你必须记住的一个重要概念是有效数字。这个概念对物理学家和所有科学家都极为重要。也就是说，如果我写下 3.05，我希望你明白它不等于 3.0500。)

$$3.05 \neq 3.0500$$

What is on the left side mathematically is equivalent to what is on the right side. But in physics, when I write 3.05, I mean it is between 3.04 and 3.06. When I write 3.0500, I mean it is between 3.0501 and 3.0499. In other words, when you write a physical quantity down, the last figure has an uncertainty of plus minus one.(数学上左边的等于右边的。但在物理学中，当我写 3.05 时，我的意思是它在 3.04 和 3.06 之间。当我写 3.0500 时，我的意思是它在 3.0501 和 3.0499 之间。换句话说，当你写下物理量时，最后一位数字有 $\pm 1$ 的不确定性。)

Therefore, these two numbers are approximately the same, but the number on the right is much more accurate than the number on the left. So these two are not identical in physics, although in mathematics they are the same. So that is called the significant figure.(因此，这两个数字大致相同，但右边的数字比左边的数字精确得多。所以这两个数字在物理学上并不完全相同，尽管在数学上它们是相同的。这就是所谓的 *有效数字*。)

This one has significant figures up to the second decimal point. This has significant figures up to the fourth decimal point. I can write 3.05. Of course, 3.05 is equal to 305 times 10 to the minus two.(这个数字的有效数字保留到小数点后两位。这个数字的有效数字保留到小数点后四位。我可以写成 3.05。当然，3.05 等于 305 乘以 10 的负二次方。)

$$3.05=305 \times 10^{-2}$$

In this case, both sides are equal mathematically and physics-wise, because the last figure has a possibility of plus minus one, and they are, of course, equivalent. You should read in the book the discussion about the significant figures. (在这种情况下，双方在数学和物理层面上都是相等的，因为最后一个数字有正负一的可能性，当然它们是等价的。你应该阅读书中关于有效数字的讨论。)

#### 光速

I want you to remember about the velocity of light. Velocity of light is 3.0 times 10 to the eighth meters per second. This is a very accurate figure, and it is universally used. But a more accurate one is given in the book.(我要你记住光速。光速是每秒 3.0 乘以 10 的 8 次方米。这是一个非常精确的数字，被普遍使用。但书中给出了更精确的数字。)

$$\text{光速}=3.0 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s}; \quad \text{精确的光速}=2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$$

It is 2.99. You see that it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Nine figures of accuracy. The reason that one can write such a number down is because in the last 30 years, it has been able to measure both time and distance so very accurately. This is a very precise number.(它是2.99。你看它有 1、2、3、4、5、6、7、8、9，九位数的精确度。之所以能写出这样一个数字，是因为在过去 30 年里，我们已经能够非常精确地测量时间和距离。这是一个极其精准的数字。)

Does anybody have any difficulties understanding my English? No difficulties. Good.（有人对我的英语理解有困难吗？没有困难。很好。） 

#### 秒的定义

There's a question that we have to discuss now, namely, how is the second defined? In the early days, the definition of a second was used in some sort of a clock. But, of course, a clock, even a very accurate clock, is not accurate enough by modern standards. （现在有一个问题我们必须讨论，即秒是如何定义的。早期，秒的定义依赖于某种时钟。但是，当然，即便是非常精确的时钟，按照现代标准来看也不够准确。）

So now it is defined on page 6 of the book. In the middle of the book is the definition. I'll read it to you. One second is the time taken by 9,192,631,770 oscillations of the light of a specified wavelength emitted by cesium-133 atom. In other words, it's defined in terms of that many periods of a specific emission from cesium. Cesium has many isotopes. Cesium-133 is one of them. And that isotope emits many lines. There's one specific line which has been chosen internationally. And that many six-billion-something oscillations is defined as one second. So it is a very precise definition.（所以现在它被定义在书的第 6 页。书的中间部分就是这个定义。我来读给你听。一秒就是铯-133 原子发射的特定波长的光完成 9,192,631,770 次振荡所用的时间。换句话说，它是根据铯原子发射的这么多周期来定义的。铯有很多同位素。铯-133 是其中之一。这种同位素会发射许多谱线。国际上选择了其中一条特定谱线。而大约 90 亿次振荡就被定义为一秒。所以这是一个非常精确的定义。）

Actually, if you want to be even more accurate, you have to further define that cesium atom has to be in vacuum. If the cesium atom is under pressure, the period may be slightly different. So when you get to such great accuracies, you have to be very, very precise. So that is the definition of a second, of the unit of time. （实际上，如果你想更精确的话，还必须进一步明确铯原子必须处于真空中。如果铯原子处于压力之下，其周期可能会略有不同。因此，当你追求如此高的精确度时，必须非常非常精确，这就是“秒”这个时间单位的定义。）

#### 米的定义

Now how about the definition of the unit of length? For that, read page 5. In page 5, there is a statement which says, the meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of that much of a second. This is now the international definition.（那么长度单位的定义又是什么呢？请翻到第 5 页。在第 5 页上有这样一段说明：米是光在真空中于 1/299792458 秒时间间隔内所经路径的长度。这就是当前国际通用的定义。）

The reason that there are these somewhat complicated definitions is because we now have the means to make very precise measurements. Originally, more than a hundred years ago, when there was an international convention about the international units, the distance, the centimeter, was defined as the distance between two marks on a ruler kept somewhere in Paris. That, you can see, cannot be very accurate, because if you have a mark, if you have two marks, the most accurate you can imagine is maybe a fraction of a millimeter.（之所以会有这些略显复杂的定义，是因为我们现在有能力对光速进行非常精确的测量。最初，在一百多年前，当国际单位制公约制定时，厘米的定义是保存在巴黎某处的尺子上两个刻度之间的距离。你可以看出，这不可能非常精确，因为如果你有两个刻度，你能想象的最精确的测量可能也就精确到毫米的几分之一。）

As time goes on, one realizes that that is not accurate enough, so therefore the definition was changed. It was changed several times, and now it reached what we just read. The time measurement is the most accurate, so therefore first you define the unit of time.（随着时间的推移，人们意识到之前的定义不够精确，因此对其进行了修改。经过多次调整后，最终形成了我们刚才所读到的定义。由于时间测量是最精确的，所以首先需要定义时间单位。）

The distance measurement is the next accurate, so one defines it by saying the distance is related, the unit meter is related to the amount of, to the length traveled by light during a certain time period. So therefore what we have, what I want you to read is unit of time defined. How is the unit of time defined? Then unit of length, then there's unit of mass.（距离测量是下一个精确的，因此人们通过说距离是相关的来定义它，单位米与光的测量有关，与光在一定时间内传播的长度有关。因此，我们拥有的，我希望你阅读的是时间单位的定义。时间单位是如何定义的？然后是长度单位，然后是质量单位。）

#### 质量

I want to emphasize here that the unit of that mass is not equal to weight. In daily language, there is confusion. We say something is one kilogram. In physics, when you say something is one kilogram, you mean its mass is one kilogram. It's related to the number of atoms and the mass of each atom added together, including the electrons, and that's the mass. So mass is a measurement of the bulk, while weight is a measurement of the force.（我想在这里强调，质量的单位（mass）不等于重量（weight）。在日常用语中，人们常常混淆这两个概念。我们说某物重一公斤。而在物理学中，当你说某物重 1 公斤时，实际上是指它的质量为 1 公斤。这与原子数量以及每个原子（包括电子）的质量总和有关，这就是质量。因此，质量是对物体总量的度量，而重量则是对力的度量。）

$$\text{mass,质量} \neq \text{weight,重量}$$

When you say that you weigh 50 kilograms, it means that the earth attracts you with a force, which we define as 50 kilograms. So mass is a measurement of the bulk, while weight is a measurement of a force. These two are related but different concepts. We are going to have more to say about this after we get to discussing the three laws of Newton. (当你说你体重 50 公斤时，这意味着地球以 50 公斤的力吸引着你。因此，质量是对物体总量的测量，而重量是对力的测量。这两者是相关但不同的概念。在我们讨论完牛顿三大定律后，我们会有更多要说的。)

Any questions about what we have said up to now? About the units? About significant figures? Actually, about everything in Chapter 1. By the way, there is in the book, near the end of every chapter, there is a section called Review and Summary. For you to test yourself, read that Review and Summary.(对我们刚才讲的内容有什么问题吗？关于单位？关于有效数字？实际上，关于第一章的所有内容都可以提问。顺便说一下，这本书在每章末尾附近都有一个名为“复习与总结”的部分。为了自我测试，你可以阅读那个“复习与总结”部分。)

If you understand everything in that section, you have captured the essence of that chapter. So while you are studying that chapter, refer to that section, and after you felt that you are finished with the chapter, read that section again to assure yourself that you have gotten everything that there is in that chapter.(如果你理解了那一部分的所有内容，你就掌握了那一章的精髓。因此，在学习那一章时，请参考那一部分，当你觉得已经学完那一章后，再读一遍那一部分，以确保你已经掌握了那一章的所有内容。)

#### 教辅材料

 By the way, if you read the handout, read the syllabus page, it tells you what is the textbook. The textbook I shall refer to as the HRW. You must have that book. Then there are the reference books, Feynman Lectures, 美国物理试题与解题第一卷，以及赵凯华和罗蔚茵所著的新概念物理教程力学部分。  (顺便说一句，如果你看了讲义，看了教学大纲页面，它会告诉你教材是什么。我将把教材称为 HRW。你必须要有那本书。此外还有参考书，费曼讲义)

#### 作业与考试说明
However, the relevant chapters of these three books, I am going to give to you. I will assign you a number of exercises around 7 or 10 every week, and you must hand them in next Monday. If you are late in handing in the exercises, your grades for that week will be discounted.（不过，这三本书的相关章节，我会发给你们。我每周会布置大约 7 到 10 个练习，你们必须在下周一之前交上来。如果迟交作业，那周的分数将会被扣减。）

And there will be a midterm, a final, and your final grade will consist of 30% of your exercise results, 30% from the midterm, and 40% from the final. That page also lists the office hours of myself and Professors Ruandong and An Yu. So, for example, for this week, if you read the syllabus, I want you to read the Halliday Textbook, Chapters 1 and 2. Also, familiarize yourself with the useful appendices A to G. Familiarize yourself does not mean that you have to remember it.（期中会有一次考试，期末也有一次考试，你的最终成绩将由 30% 的练习成绩、30% 的期中考试成绩和 40% 的期末考试成绩组成。那一页还列出了我和 Ruandong 教授以及An Yu 教授的办公时间。例如，本周如果你读了教学大纲，我希望你阅读 Halliday 教科书的第 1 章和第 2 章。同时，熟悉一下有用的附录 A 到 G。熟悉并不意味着你必须记住它们。）

It's just that you know that there are these appendices, and at the proper moment, you know where to find, for example, an accurate expression for the velocity of light or for the Planck's constant or for a specific formula giving you an integral. If you just flip through the pages and sort of scan appendices A to G, those are very useful information for you. And then the first week's exercises are listed underneath, A, B, C, D, up to H. （只是你要知道有这些附录，在适当的时候，你知道去哪里找，比如光速的精确表达式、普朗克常数，或者给出积分的特定公式。如果你只是翻翻书页，大致浏览一下附录 A 到 G，这些对你来说是非常有用的信息。然后第一周的练习列在下面，A、B、C、D，一直到 H。你应该做这些练习，下周一交给我）

### 第二章：直线运动

Okay, no questions? Then we'll go to chapter two. Chapter two talks about the motion along a straight line. It's a one-dimensional motion.（好的，没问题了吗？那我们进入第二章。第二章讲的是直线运动，也就是一维运动。）

#### 平均速度与瞬时速度

Now, we all are familiar with some concepts. After all, we travel around, we move around, and we ride in cars. So there is the concept of an average velocity. What is the meaning of an average velocity? If you are traveling along a line, you go from here to here, there's a distance between them. Let's call that distance delta x. The distance divided by the time. Delta t is the time interval. Delta x is the distance. （现在，我们都熟悉一些概念。毕竟，我们四处旅行，四处走动，还乘坐汽车。因此，就有了平均速度的概念。平均速度的含义是什么？如果你沿着一条直线移动，从这里到这里，它们之间有一段距离。我们称这段距离为 $\Delta x$。距离除以时间。$\Delta t$ 是时间间隔。$\Delta x$ 是距离。）

By the way, is this pen too thick? Is it better to use a thin one? So the distance traveled, the delta x, divided by the time interval of that motion, that is the average velocity. So this concept is elementary.(顺便问一下，这支笔是不是太粗了？用细一点的会不会更好？所以移动的距离，也就是 $\Delta x$，除以运动的时间间隔，就是 *平均速度*。这个概念很基础。)

$$\text{平均速度}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

Now, if I now take half of the time, so this is the average velocity during this interval. If I now say I only look at the same motion, but only look at this distance, then I get another average velocity. So you can have an average velocity of this interval, this longer interval, or the average velocity in a shorter interval.(现在，如果我只取一半的时间，那么这就是这段时间内的平均速度。如果我现在说，我只观察同样的运动，但只关注这段距离，那么我就会得到另一个平均速度。所以你可以有这段时间的平均速度，这个更长的时间段的平均速度，或者更短时间段的平均速度。)

If you now make that interval shorter and shorter, you get, when you go to zero distance, that velocity, that average velocity is called instantaneous velocity. And that is what is important. So it is equal to limit of this average velocity as the interval goes to zero.(如果你现在让这个时间间隔越来越短，当距离趋近于零时，那个速度，即平均速度，就被称为 *瞬时速度*。这才是关键所在。因此，它等于当时间间隔趋近于零时这个平均速度的极限。)

$$\text{瞬时速度}=\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} $$

Now, if the motion has a uniform velocity, then it doesn't matter whether you take the average velocity of a long interval or a short interval. But if, for example, it's a curve that's accelerating, then the instantaneous velocity at the beginning is not the same as the instantaneous velocity later. So, in general, the instantaneous velocity is not necessarily equal to the average velocity at any time.(现在，如果运动具有匀速，那么取长区间或短区间的平均速度并不重要。但如果运动是加速的曲线，那么初始的瞬时速度与之后的瞬时速度就不相同。因此，一般来说，瞬时速度并不一定在任何时候都等于平均速度。)

This quantity, when you take a ratio and go to the limit of infinitesimal intervals, that is a concept fundamental to differential calculus. And in differential calculus, one writes it as dx dt. If you have studied differential calculus, you would be familiar with this.(这个量，当你取一个比率并趋近于无穷小间隔的极限时，就是微分学中的一个基本概念。在微分学中，人们将其写作 dx/dt。如果你学过微分学，对此应该很熟悉。)

#### 微积分、牛顿、莱布尼茨的小故事

If you have not, you will be learning it both here and in your calculus course within the next week or two. Does anybody know who invented the differential calculus? Differential calculus was invented by two people, Isaac Newton and Leibniz. Newton was born 1642, and Leibniz was born ... The birth of differential and integral calculus is a great event in the history of mankind.(如果你还没有学过微积分，接下来一两周内你将在这里和微积分课程中学习它。有人知道是谁发明了微分学吗？微分学是由两个人发明的，艾萨克·牛顿和莱布尼茨。牛顿出生于 1642 年(1642-1727)，莱布尼茨出生于...(1646-1716)  微分学和积分学的诞生是人类历史上的一件大事。)

One of the reasons that the Chinese science, modern science, did not develop in China was because, for various reasons, differential calculus was never invented in China. Actually, after you have learned differential and integral calculus, you will realize that it's the most elementary concept. It is the most natural concept.(中国科学，即现代科学，未能在本土发展起来的原因之一在于，由于种种因素，中国始终未曾发明微积分。事实上，当你学过微分和积分后，就会意识到这是最基础的概念，也是最自然的概念。)

That is a general situation relating to many physical laws. Before you understand it, it may not be reachable. But after you understood it in a more precise manner, you realize that it is a very natural and very simple thing.(这是一种与许多物理定律相关的普遍情况。在你理解它之前，它可能遥不可及。但当你以更精确的方式理解它后，你会发现它其实是一件非常自然且非常简单的事情。)

And differential calculus is a very good example of that situation. Newton clearly used differential calculus to write his big book, and that book is universally regarded as the beginning of modern science. It's called Principia Mathematica. It was published in 1687. But a very strange thing happened. Although he clearly developed both differential and integral calculus, he did not use differential or integral calculus in his book(而微分学就是这种情况的一个很好的例子。牛顿显然运用了微分学来撰写他的巨著，而这本书被普遍认为是现代科学的开端。它被称为《自然哲学的数学原理》。该书出版于 1687 年。但发生了一件非常奇怪的事——虽然他明确发展出了微分学和积分学，却未在著作中使用这两种演算方法。)

This is called derivative. dx dt is called the derivative of x with respect to t. Derivative is 导数 If you look at the dictionary I gave you, derivative is 导数. dx dt is the derivative of x with respect to t. Newton, in his work leading to Principia Mathematica, clearly used differential and integral calculus.(这被称为导数。dx/dt 被称为 x 关于 t 的导数。Derivative 就是导数。如果你查阅我给你的字典，Derivative 就是导数。dx/dt 是 x 关于 t 的导数。牛顿在他撰写《自然哲学的数学原理》的过程中，并未使用了微分和积分运算。)

In fact, most of what was in Principia was done 20 years before that. It was done in the year 1666. But the publication was delayed by 20 years, partly because he needed to prove the following.（事实上，《自然哲学的数学原理》中的大部分内容早在 20 年前就已完成了。那是在 1666年完成的。但出版却推迟了 20 年，部分原因是他需要证明以下内容。）

Principia Mathematica produced a tremendous impact on mankind because it explained the planetary motion of all the planets around the sun and the motion of the moon around the earth. But in order to discuss, for example, the motion of the earth around the sun, he knew he had to deal with two spheres. A big sphere, which is the sun, and a small sphere, which is the earth.（《数学原理》对人类产生了巨大影响，因为它解释了所有行星围绕太阳运行的规律以及月球围绕地球的运动。但为了讨论例如地球绕太阳公转的问题，牛顿意识到必须处理两个球体的相互作用：一个是巨大的太阳，另一个则是相对渺小的地球。）

Now in his original calculation, he took the sun to be one point, a heavy point, and he took the earth to be a lighter point, but both of them are points, and one small point, the road going around, a heavier point. Then there's the question of, OK, but the sun is not a point, it's a sphere. So he had to prove that when you have universal gravitation, the universal gravitational force between a small sphere and a big sphere gives you a motion which is the same as if those two were just points.（在他最初的计算中，他将太阳视为一个重质点，将地球视为一个轻质点，但两者都被简化为质点——一个较重的小点，一个较轻的小点绕着它运行。但问题在于：太阳并非质点，而是球体。因此他必须证明，当存在万有引力时，大小两个球体之间的引力作用所产生的运动规律，与将两者视为质点时的运动规律完全一致。）

This requires an integral calculus, and it took him 20 years before he completely satisfied himself that that was correct. But the thing which is very strange is that when he wrote the Principia Mathematica, he did not use differential calculus, he did not use integral calculus. The whole of Principia was written in terms of a language similar to Euclid's geometry.（这需要用到积分运算，而他花了 20 年时间才完全确信这是正确的。但非常奇怪的是，当他撰写《自然哲学的数学原理》时，他并没有使用微分运算，也没有使用积分运算。整部《原理》都是用类似于欧几里得几何的语言写成的。）

I'm pretty sure in high school you have learned geometry, and that geometry follows the style of Euclid. You start with some axioms, then you have some propositions, then you have proofs, and you have corollaries, etc., etc. Newton patterned his big important book exactly like Euclid in this style.（我很确定你在高中时学过几何学，而那种几何学遵循的是欧几里得的风格。你从一些公理开始，然后有一些命题，接着是证明，还有推论等等。牛顿在他那本重要的巨著中完全模仿了欧几里得的这种风格。）

Not only this, he tried to prove everything as if it's a geometrical problem. Because of that, for the last 20 or 30 years, very few people have really plowed through the whole book. Everybody knows it's a most important book, but it's too complicated, because if you do things with differential and integral calculus, it becomes very simple.（不仅如此，他还试图将一切都当作几何问题来证明。正因如此，过去二三十年间，真正通读全书的人寥寥无几。众所周知，这是一部极其重要的著作，但它过于复杂——因为如果用微积分来处理这些问题，就会变得非常简单。）

But if you don't use that and do it geometrically, it becomes very complicated. The great astrophysicist Chandrasekhar. Chandrasekhar was born around 1910, so he was some 10 or 11 years older than I am. In his old age, he decided to understand precisely the geometrical arguments of Newton in the Principia. Chandrasekhar was very proud of this book. I didn't read it, but if you are interested, you could go to the library. I'm sure the library has a copy of Chandrasekhar's modern interpretation of what Newton has done geometrically in the Principia. （但如果你不那样做，而是用几何方法来解决，就会变得非常复杂。伟大的天体物理学家钱德拉塞卡。钱德拉塞卡出生于 1910 年左右，所以他比我大 10 岁或 11 岁。晚年时，他决定深入研究牛顿在《自然哲学的数学原理》中的几何论证。钱德拉塞卡对这本书感到非常自豪。我虽然没读过，但如果你感兴趣，可以去图书馆借阅。我确信图书馆里有钱德拉塞卡对牛顿在《自然哲学的数学原理》中几何方法所做的现代解读版本。）

Leibniz was a German mathematician, and he was not so much a physicist like Newton was. He was more a pure mathematician. And it is now believed that he independently invented differential and integral calculus. But he had correspondence with Newton, so there was great controversy about whether their discoveries were independent or not independent. And that became one of the great scholarly debates around the end of the 17th century.（莱布尼茨是德国数学家，他并不像牛顿那样是物理学家，而更偏向于纯粹数学家。现在人们认为他独立发明了微积分。但他与牛顿有过通信往来，因此关于他们的发现是否独立存在很大争议。这成为 17 世纪末最重大的学术争论之一。）

In earlier centuries, before the 20th century, the biographers, all biographers, tend to only say good things about a famous name. For example, there were biographies of Newton. And in these biographies, Newton was a great man, and he was almost perfect. But in the 20th century... By the way, that is more or less the kind of style of biographers in China in ancient times. But starting in the 20th century, there is a new movement of biographies in the West. There began a style in which one tries to paint the whole person.（在 20 世纪之前的几个世纪里，所有传记作家都倾向于只对名人说好话。例如，有一些关于牛顿的传记。在这些传记中，牛顿是一个伟大的人，他几乎是完美的。但在20世纪……顺便提一句，这或多或少是中国古代传记作家的写作风格。但从 20 世纪开始，西方兴起了新的传记写作风潮，开始出现一种试图描绘人物全貌的风格。）

And now there are many biographies which show that Newton, though a great scientist, was not a likable man. He was not a kind person. He was vindictive, and he was not a person who was well-liked. And the controversy between him and Leibniz was one of the things that dominated the end of his life. If you go to the library, you can browse through some of the books which give details of the life of Newton.（而现在有很多传记表明，牛顿虽然是一位伟大的科学家，却并不是一个讨人喜欢的人。他不是一个善良的人。他报复心强，也不是一个受欢迎的人。他与莱布尼茨之间的争议是他晚年生活中的重要事件之一。如果你去图书馆，可以翻阅一些详细记载牛顿生平的书籍。）

 Now one of the controversies between Newton and Leibniz was what symbol to use for the derivative. dx dt is the derivative of x with respect to t. That is the notation of Leibniz. It was not the notation of Newton. Newton did not use the word derivative. Newton called it the fluxion. Today nobody uses the word fluxion. And the notation of Newton was very awkward, while this dx dt notation is very convenient. So today everybody uses Leibniz notation. （当时牛顿和莱布尼茨争论的一个焦点就是该用什么符号来表示导数。dx/dt 是 x 对 t 的导数。这是莱布尼茨的符号表示法。牛顿并没有使用这种符号。牛顿没有使用“导数”这个词，他称之为“流数”。如今没有人再用“流数”这个词了。牛顿的符号表示法非常笨拙，而这种 dx/dt 的符号表示法非常方便。所以现在大家都用莱布尼茨符号。）

Okay, so we'll have a five-minute recess, and then we come in. (好的，我们休息五分钟，然后回来。)
