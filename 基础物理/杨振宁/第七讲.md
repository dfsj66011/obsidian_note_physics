First of all, I want to thank the whole class. Then I talked to them. They hope that I can have a chance to talk to you in class. So I want to choose two times. I want to talk to Professor Ruan and Professor An about when is the best time to give you two extra lectures.（首先，我要感谢全班同学。然后我和他们谈了谈。他们希望我能有机会在课堂上和你们交流。所以我打算选两个时间。我想和阮教授、安教授商量一下，什么时候最适合给你们加两节课。）

I'll tell you when we are ready. I also asked them... Is he unable to come in? I also asked them... I told them that there are some books that you can read in class. They said that there is a problem. Because those books can be borrowed. If you borrow them, 120 people have borrowed them. So you can't read them.（等我们准备好了我会告诉你。我还问过他们……他是不是不能来？我还问过他们……我告诉他们有些书可以在课堂上阅读。他们说有问题。因为这些书可以外借。如果借出去的话，已经有120个人借过了。所以你们不能读这些书。）

I think the only way to make up for it is to write a few more books. A few more books. Maybe you can read some of them. Let me introduce them to you. The first book is Seagrey. He wrote a book. I don't know the name of the book. From Falling Bodies, etc. There is a book in the school library. I don't remember if it is translated or original. Seagrey is an important physicist. He is about 20 years older than me.（我想唯一的弥补方式就是多写几本书。再多写几本。也许你能读其中的一些。让我来介绍一下。第一本是西格雷的书。他写了一本书。我不记得书名了。从《落体》等等。学校图书馆里有一本。我不记得是译本还是原著。西格雷是一位重要的物理学家。他大概比我大20岁。）

* Emilio Segrè：From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries
* E.T.Bell：Men of Mathematics.
* G. Gamow：Mr. Tompkins
* James D. Watson：Double Helix
*  Abraham Pais：Subtle is the Lord

He followed Fermi in the 1930s. Enrico Fermi is one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. Before Fermi, Italian physics was not very popular. Fermi led a few people. They did a series of experiments in the 1930s. It is very important. These experiments are called Slow Neutrons. It is very easy for slow neutrons to cause nuclear reactions. This is their big discovery.（20世纪30年代，他追随费米的脚步。恩里科·费米是20世纪最伟大的物理学家之一。在费米之前，意大利物理学并不十分出名。费米带领少数人，在30年代进行了一系列重要实验，这些被称为"慢中子"的实验意义重大——他们发现慢中子极易引发核反应，这是他们的重大发现。）

Seagrey was one of Fermi's group. I can tell you an important story. I don't know if this story is in the book. In Italy, a professor of physics is appointed by the Ministry of Education. Not like here. For example, there is a professor of physics from Tsinghua University.（Segrè 是费米小组的一员。我可以告诉你一个重要的故事。我不知道这本书里是否有这个故事。在意大利，物理学教授是由教育部任命的。不像这里。比如，有一位来自清华大学的物理学教授。）

In the United States, there is also a professor of physics from Stony Brook University. In Italy, all professors of physics are still appointed by the Roman government. If there is a vacancy in one of the universities, the ministry will discuss which is the best candidate. So there is competition all the time. One of the universities that had a vacancy was Palermo. Palermo is the capital of Sicily.（在美国，还有一位来自石溪大学的物理学教授。在意大利，所有的物理学教授仍由罗马政府任命。如果某所大学出现空缺职位，教育部会讨论谁是最佳人选。因此竞争始终存在。其中一所出现职位空缺的大学是巴勒莫大学。巴勒莫是西西里的首府。）

Sicily is a big island. It is a beautiful place. But the university of Palermo was not famous. Seagrey was appointed to become a professor at Palermo. He was very disappointed. He spent several years there and that was a time when he was unhappy. But during that time, he visited Berkeley, California. Berkeley at that time had the world's largest cyclotron. In a cyclotron, you accelerate particles.（西西里岛是一个大岛。这里风景优美，但巴勒莫大学并不出名。西格雷被任命为巴勒莫大学教授时非常失望。他在那里度过了几年郁郁寡欢的时光。不过在此期间，他造访了加利福尼亚的伯克利分校——当时那里拥有世界上最大的回旋加速器。回旋加速器正是用来加速粒子的装置。）

Then you use those particles like alpha particles to hit a nucleus. Then there are fragments and you study the fragments. After you do it for, let's say, six months, the body that is hit becomes very radioactive. In those days, they didn't pay attention, so they just put it in the corner and put a new target in there. So when Seagrey visited Berkeley, he found a pile of discarded targets there. He was very intelligent.（然后你用这些粒子，比如α粒子，去轰击一个原子核。接着会产生碎片，你就研究这些碎片。假设你这样做六个月后，被轰击的物质会变得极具放射性。那时候人们并不在意，所以就把它们扔在角落里，换上新的靶材。所以当西格雷访问伯克利时，他发现那里堆着一堆废弃的靶材。他非常聪明。）

He went to Lawrence, who was the director. He said, you have all these used targets. Could I have a piece? Lawrence said, sure. So he took a piece back to Palermo, and there he made an analysis and he found element 43. If you remember, Mondelez had this periodic table, and at the beginning of the 20th century, it was filled up, but there were a few vacancies because nobody had found those elements. And Seagrey went back.（他去找了劳伦斯，就是那位主管。他说，你们有这么多用过的靶材，能给我一块吗？劳伦斯说，当然可以。于是他带了一块回巴勒莫，在那里做了分析，发现了43号元素。如果你还记得，门德列夫有张元素周期表，20世纪初时已经填满了大部分，但还有几个空缺因为没人发现那些元素。而西格雷回去后……）

Element 43 was not natural. There's no natural substance with 43, but in cyclotron, it's artificially created, and so he found it. So that was what made him a very distinguished physicist. This is a very interesting story. What it means is that in the frontiers, you have all kinds of opportunities. You have to have a sharp eye, and all these distinguished physicists in Berkeley did not realize that there is something to be found in the pile of used targets, but he had the bright idea.（第43号元素并非天然存在。自然界中没有含有43号元素的物质，但在回旋加速器中，它被人工制造出来，因此他发现了它。正是这一点使他成为一位非常杰出的物理学家。这是一个非常有趣的故事。这意味着在科学前沿，你拥有各种各样的机会。你必须具备敏锐的眼光，而伯克利所有那些杰出的物理学家都没有意识到，在一堆废弃的靶材中可能有所发现，但他却想到了这个绝妙的主意。）

He then went to the United States and did very distinguished work. He was the thesis advisor of Wu Jianxiong. When Wu Jianxiong went to Berkeley to get her PhD, she studied with Seagrey. And then this book was very interesting. I had more or less read it. The next one is E.T. Bell's Men of Mathematics.（随后他去了美国，并做出了非常杰出的工作。他是吴健雄的论文导师。当吴健雄去伯克利攻读博士学位时，她师从西格雷。这本书非常有趣，我或多或少读过一些。下一本是E.T.贝尔的《数学大师》。）

E.T. Bell was a professor of mathematics in America, and he wrote this book in the 1920s or 1930s. It's a collection of some 20 short biographies of great mathematicians. It exerted a profound influence. In fact, it influenced me. When I was a freshman in 西南联大, my father, who was a professor of mathematics, borrowed from the library this book. So I began to read it, and it talks about great mathematicians and their contributions.（E.T.贝尔是美国的一位数学教授，他在20世纪20或30年代写了这本书。书中汇集了约20位伟大数学家的简短传记。这本书产生了深远的影响。事实上，它也影响了我。当我还是西南联大的一名新生时，我父亲——他本人也是一位数学教授——从图书馆借来了这本书。于是我开始阅读，书中讲述了伟大数学家们及其贡献的故事。）

I didn't understand most of the contributions, but the stories were very fascinating. Now, the book was not only famous in China, it was famous all over the world. Now I read that there are people who say that this book is not entirely reliable. In other words, what Bell said about some mathematicians was not entirely reliable. But nevertheless, it was a very interesting book, and it had a profound influence. In particular, there is a chapter about Hamilton.（我对大部分贡献都不太理解，但那些故事非常引人入胜。如今，这本书不仅在中国闻名，更享誉全球。现在我读到有人说这本书并非完全可信，也就是说贝尔对某些数学家的描述并不完全可靠。尽管如此，这仍是一本非常有趣的书，产生了深远的影响。尤其是关于哈密尔顿的那一章。）

Hamilton was a great mathematician and physicist. I told you that he invented the quaternion. And that chapter in E.T. Bell's book about Hamilton was called an Irish tragedy because Hamilton was from Ireland.（汉密尔顿是一位伟大的数学家和物理学家。我告诉过你，他发明了四元数。E.T.贝尔书中关于汉密尔顿的那一章被称为爱尔兰悲剧，因为汉密尔顿来自爱尔兰。）

And E.T. Bell thought that Hamilton's life was a tragedy because in the latter part of Hamilton's life, after he invented the quaternion, he devoted all his efforts to make quaternion the basic mathematics or physics, but unsuccessful. However, I think E.T. Bell is not quite right. I have the feeling, I think I told you a few times ago, I have the feeling that the quaternion will enter into physics in a major way, but not yet.（E.T.贝尔认为汉密尔顿的一生是个悲剧，因为在他生命的后半段，发明四元数之后，他倾尽全力想让四元数成为数学或物理学的基础，但未能成功。然而，我认为E.T.贝尔并不完全正确。我有一种感觉——我想我之前告诉过你几次——我觉得四元数终将以重要方式进入物理学领域，只是时机未到。）

And that I had written about in my selected papers. If you refer to one of my early lectures, I had said that. The next one is Gamow. Gamow was a distinguished physicist. He was maybe 15 years older than I am. He was a Russian physicist, but he escaped from Stalin's Soviet Union by sailing a boat in the Black Seas.（我在我的论文选集中已经写过这一点。如果你参考我早期的某次演讲，我曾提到过。下一位是伽莫夫。伽莫夫是一位杰出的物理学家。他大概比我年长15岁。他是俄罗斯物理学家，但通过驾驶小船横渡黑海逃离了斯大林的苏联。）

And from there he got to America and he settled in America. He was a physicist and astronomer. He had many important contributions. The most important was he was the one who explained the long lifetime of radioactivity in the late 1920s. Many people believe he should have won a Nobel Prize for that. The reason that he didn't win a Nobel Prize is because there were so many important pieces of work.（他从那里去了美国，并在美国定居下来。他是一位物理学家和天文学家，做出了许多重要贡献。其中最重要的是，他在20世纪20年代末解释了放射性物质长寿命的原因。许多人认为他本应因此获得诺贝尔奖。他没有获奖的原因是当时有太多重要的研究成果。）

So there were many candidates for Nobel Prizes in those days. And as a consequence, he never got it. Most people believe, and I subscribe to that theory, if his contribution were moved to today, he would receive a Nobel Prize. He wrote this book in a very humorous way, and it's a very interesting book. It's about special relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a good friend of Edward Teller, my thesis advisor.（因此，当时诺贝尔奖的候选人很多。结果，他从未获奖。大多数人认为——我也认同这一观点——如果他的贡献放在今天，他一定能获得诺贝尔奖。他以非常幽默的方式写了这本书，内容非常有趣，主要讲述狭义相对论和量子力学。他是我导师爱德华·泰勒的好友。）

And he talked in a very loud voice, and there were many stories about him. He liked to drink. He oftentimes got very drunk. And there's also another thing about him. Namely, you know that with the genetic code, it is three units of the DNA that code one protein. And in the 70s, there was a question of how many units. We now know it's three units. The question at that time was how many units of the DNA codes one protein. And Gamow speculated it's three.（他说话声音很大，关于他的故事也很多。他喜欢喝酒，经常喝得酩酊大醉。关于他还有另一件事。你知道，在遗传密码中，三个DNA单元编码一个蛋白质。在70年代，人们还不清楚具体需要多少个单元。我们现在知道是三个单元。当时的问题是，多少个DNA单元编码一个蛋白质。伽莫夫推测是三个。）

That turns out to be correct, but the reason was wrong. What was his reason? His reason was a combinatorial statement. He said that if n units code a protein, and one knows there are four bases, A, C, T, G. So the question is, if you select n things out of four, with repetition allowed, what should n be in order that the number of possibilities is 20? Because he knows there are 20 proteins.（事实证明这是正确的，但理由却是错的。他的理由是什么呢？他的理由是一个组合数学的陈述。他说，如果n个单位编码一个蛋白质，而我们知道有四种碱基：A、C、T、G。那么问题来了：如果从这四种碱基中允许重复地选取n个，n 应该是多少才能使可能的组合数达到20？因为他知道有 20 种蛋白质。）

So the question is, out of n DNA units, with the possible repetition of the four, what is n so that the total number of different choices is 20? Now, that's a combinatorial problem. Go back and think about it. It is three. So he wrote that n should be three. We now know three is correct, but it's wrong for two reasons. Reason number one, he did not consider the order of the three.（那么问题来了，在n个DNA单元中，四种碱基可以重复出现的情况下，n取何值时不同的选择总数是20？这是一个组合问题。回过头想想，答案是3。于是他写下n应该等于3。我们现在知道3是正确的，但这个结论错在两点：第一，他没有考虑这三个碱基的排列顺序。）

While the combinatorial problem had no concept about the order of the three DNA units. So that's a mistake, number one. Number two, he thought it's unique that each choice corresponds to one protein, and there are 20 proteins.（虽然组合问题没有关于三个DNA单元顺序的概念。所以这是一个错误，第一点。第二点，他认为每个选择对应一个蛋白质是独特的，而蛋白质有20种。）

But it turns out that in actual practice, there are several possibilities, ordered triplets, that code the same protein. So he was wrong in two accounts, but the number was correct. This is a very long story among the biologists.（但事实证明，在实际操作中，存在多种可能性，即有序的三联体可以编码相同的蛋白质。因此，他在两个方面都错了，但数字是正确的。这在生物学家中是一个流传已久的故事。）

I tell you this story because with a purpose. There is a feeling among the international physicists of exuberance, that you think about all kinds of things, and don't be afraid that you make a mistake. And that is characteristic of many physicists, especially Gamow and Teller. But that is different from the lesson that you learn in China. The lesson that you learn in China has a tendency to make you very focused. I have repeatedly said that both have advantages.（我讲这个故事是有目的的。国际物理学界有一种充满活力的氛围，你可以思考各种问题，不必担心犯错。这是许多物理学家的特点，尤其是伽莫夫和特勒。但这与中国教育所强调的有所不同。中国的教育往往让你非常专注。我多次说过，两者各有优势。）

So do not think that the is necessarily better. But if you are immersed in one system, it is best if you absorb some of the advantages of the other system. The next one is James Watson's Double Helix. （所以不要以为这个就一定更好。但如果你沉浸在一个体系中，最好能吸收另一个体系的一些优点。下一本是詹姆斯·沃森的《双螺旋》。）

This is a very important book. Watson, in 1953, with Crick, who recently died, wrote this most important paper about the Double Helix, which is undoubtedly the greatest paper in biological sciences of the 20th century. And they won the Nobel Prize, I think, in the early 60s.(这是一本非常重要的书。沃森在1953年与不久前去世的克里克共同撰写了这篇关于双螺旋结构的重要论文，这无疑是20世纪生物科学领域最伟大的论文。我想他们是在60年代初获得了诺贝尔奖。 )

And then, later on, he wrote this book, which is a popular book, which describes the history of his discovery with Crick. It's a very interesting book, because it tells you how young American scientists go about doing their work. They are not learned. (后来，他写了这本书，这是一本很受欢迎的书，描述了他和克里克一起发现的历史。这本书非常有趣，因为它告诉你年轻的美国科学家是如何开展工作的。他们并不博学。)

They don't study very hard, and they don't know too much. But they are full of enthusiasm, and they work very hard, and they are not afraid of anything. And that book essentially says, such a way could achieve great things. The next one is Abraham Pais's Subtle is the Lord. That is the biography of Einstein. Now, by now, there must be 20 or 30 biographies of Einstein of various kinds.(他们学习并不十分刻苦，懂得也不多。但他们充满热情，工作非常努力，而且无所畏惧。那本书的核心观点是，这样的方式也能成就大事。接下来是亚伯拉罕·派斯的《上帝是微妙的》，这是爱因斯坦的传记。时至今日，市面上肯定已有二三十种不同版本的爱因斯坦传记了。)

This is absolutely the best. Everybody regards this as the best biography. Abraham Pice was my colleague. 我在Institute for Advanced Study跟他同事了十几年。 He was a distinguished physicist. He made important contributions to physics. But after he was 60 or thereabouts, he started to write books.（这绝对是最好的。所有人都认为这是最好的传记。亚伯拉罕·派斯是我的同事。我在高等研究院与他共事了十几年。他是一位杰出的物理学家，为物理学做出了重要贡献。但在他60岁左右时，他开始写书。）

And the first book that he wrote was this book. And it's a very good biography of Einstein, both in terms of his analysis of Einstein's physics, and in terms of his analysis of the personality of Einstein. And this book has been translated a few years ago, and there's a recent revised translation.（他写的第一本书就是这本。这是一本关于爱因斯坦的非常好的传记，既分析了爱因斯坦的物理学成就，也剖析了他的性格。这本书几年前已被翻译过，最近又出了修订版。）

It's a Shang Wen Shu Guan, 2004. The translator is a man named Fang. I'm pretty sure our library has both the English and the translation.最後呢,我推薦這個article, 清華大學學報哲學社會科學版2004年第四期。 我推薦這個原因是因為, in May of this year, 中文系, 清華大學的中文系的老師請我去跟他們的學生隨便談談。 所以我就去了,跟他們談了一個多鐘頭。 他們記錄下來了,然後把它印出來了。 你們如果找這個看看的話, 至少你對於我一些, 對於亂七八糟的很多事情的一些想法, 你們從這上可以看到。（这是2004年发表在《尚文书馆》上的一篇文章，译者是一位姓方的先生。我很确定我们图书馆同时收藏了英文版和译本。最后，我推荐这篇发表在《清华大学学报（哲学社会科学版）》2004年第四期的文章。推荐理由是：今年五月，清华大学中文系的老师邀请我去和他们的学生随便聊聊。于是我去了，和他们谈了一个多小时。他们做了记录，后来整理成文发表了。如果你们找来看看的话，至少能从中了解我对各种杂七杂八事情的一些想法。） 


上回我們一個重要的結果, 是說天然氣, fire, 減去kinetic energy, initial, 是等於the work done, 這個work是on the body, dot into ds, 我要emphasize,這是on the body, 不是這個body所做的work, body所做的work is the opposite of this. 所以, the work done on the body serves to increase the kinetic energy of the particle. 而且我要特別要跟你們講, 這f dot dx可以是negative, 假如, 假如f向這方向走,dx向這方向走, 那就是比如說, if a body is moving toward me, and I try to oppose it, but the body is still moving toward me, then f and dx are opposite to each other in direction, so cosine of the angle is negative.（上回我们一个重要的结果，是说最后的动能-最初的动能是等于做的功大小，这个功是施加在物体上的功，我要强调，这个功是施加在物体上的，不是物体所做的功。物体所做的功是相反的。因此，施加在物体上的功会增加粒子的动能。而且我要特别说明，这个 $f \cdot dx$ 可以是负的。比如说，如果力的方向是这样，而位移的方向是相反的，比如说，如果一个物体朝我移动，而我试图阻止它，但物体仍然朝我移动，那么力和位移的方向是相反的，所以角度的余弦是负的。）

So, the body is, so I'm doing negative work on the body, which means the body's kinetic energy will decrease, which is of course in agreement with our intuition. Notice f dot dx may be negative, or integral may be negative. Next we move to section 7.4, work done by gravitational force.(因此，物体在做负功，这意味着物体的动能会减少，这当然与我们的直觉一致。注意f点dx可能是负的，或者积分可能是负的。接下来我们转到第7.4节，重力所做的功。)

The work done should be integral of f gravitational, gravitational force on a body, dot dx. But we know what the gravitational force is. Let us take the z-axis to go upwards, then we know fg is equal to g times k. k is the, k is the unit vector upwards, so minus k is the unit vector downwards, so this is the force.(所做的功应该是f引力，即作用在物体上的引力，点乘dx的积分。但我们知道引力是什么。假设z轴向上，那么我们知道fg等于g乘以k。k是向上的单位矢量，所以负k就是向下的单位矢量，因此这就是力的表达式。)

But, so this is equal to minus g times integral k dot dx. dx is equal to dx dy dz, but k has no x and y component, so this is d equal to dz. Right? Okay? So it's equal to minus g times integral of dz, of course it's equal to the final z minus the original z. So if a body is moved upwards, suppose it's this way, then z final is higher than the initial. This is the final, this is the initial. So z final is bigger than initial, so this quantity is negative. That means the gravitational force has done a negative work on it.(但是，这就等于负g乘以k点dx的积分。dx等于dx dy dz，但k没有x和y分量，所以这等于dz。对吧？明白吗？所以它等于负g乘以dz的积分，当然就等于最终的z减去初始的z。如果一个物体向上移动，假设是这样，那么最终的z比初始的高。这是最终位置，这是初始位置。所以最终的z比初始的大，这个量是负的。这意味着重力对它做了负功。)

Now let us write down the theorem. The theorem says kinetic energy final minus kinetic energy initial, that's equal to the work done. So that's equal to minus gf, plus, right to the left side is the increase of kinetic energy, and that's equal to the work done on the body, which is what we just computed.(现在让我们写下这个定理。定理指出，末动能减去初动能等于所做的功。因此，这等于负重力势能加上，右边是动能的增加量，等于作用在物体上的功，也就是我们刚刚计算的结果。)

$$\text{最终动能}-\text{初始动能} =  \int \vec{F}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{x}=\int (-mg \vec{k}) \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{x}=-mg \int \mathrm{d}z=-mg(z_{f}-z_{i})$$
所以有:

$$K_{f}-K_{i}=-mgz_{f} + mgz_{i}  \quad \to \quad K_{i}+mgz_{i}=K_{f}+mgz_{f}$$

So now I move this, I get kinetic energy final, plus gz initial, or the gz initial, or final, is equal to kinetic energy initial, plus gz initial. Sorry. Sorry, I missed an m. The force is equal to minus, there's an m times here. So there's an m here, there's an m here. In other words, this is called total energy. Total energy is equal to kinetic energy initial, kinetic energy plus what is called potential energy.(那么现在我移动这个，我得到最终的动能，加上初始的gz，或者说初始的gz，或者最终的，等于初始的动能，加上初始的gz。抱歉，抱歉，我漏了一个m。力等于负的，这里有一个m乘以。所以这里有一个m，这里也有一个m。换句话说，这被称为总能量。总能量等于初始的动能，动能加上所谓的势能。)

This part is mgz. It's equal to potential energy. Kinetic energy plus potential energy is called total energy. And this formula merely says total energy is not changed. And that's conservation of energy. This is conservation of energy for this mechanical system. So the net result is that first we introduce a concept that with gravitational force, we have a concept of the existing potential energy is equal to mgz. z is the upward coordinate. You might ask, where do you take the z to be zero? So this potential energy is a relative quantity.(这部分是mgz，它等于势能。动能加势能称为总能量。这个公式仅仅说明总能量不变，这就是能量守恒。这是该机械系统的能量守恒。所以最终结果是，首先我们引入一个概念：在重力作用下，我们有一个存在的势能概念，等于mgz。z是向上的坐标。你可能会问，z的零点取在哪里？因此这个势能是一个相对量。)

You can take any place to be z equal to zero. But of course, your friend may not take the same convention. But it doesn't matter. Because once I take the origin of the z-axis, I have to stick with it. And when I use it, I will have conservation of energy. Then if I move that axis, it balances out on the initial and the final part. So it doesn't matter. So therefore, we have a concept of a potential energy, which is relatively defined. And we have a concept of a kinetic energy, which is one-half mv squared.(你可以任意选择z等于零的位置。当然，你的朋友可能不会采用相同的约定。但这并不重要。因为一旦我确定了z轴的原点，就必须保持一致。当我使用时，能量守恒定律依然成立。如果我移动那个轴，初始和最终部分会相互平衡。所以这无关紧要。因此，我们有了势能的概念，它是相对定义的。我们还有动能的概念，即二分之一mv平方。)

And we have a concept of a total energy, which is the sum of the two. And the important thing is that that energy is not changed. This is a very important... In principle, it is very important. And in practice, it helps you to calculate many things very easily, as I'll show you in a few minutes. I think we have defined the units of work or energy. If you raise one... If you have one newton force and go a distance of one meter, it's one joule.(我们有一个总能量的概念，它是这两者的总和。重要的是这个能量不会改变。这一点非常关键……从原理上讲极为重要。而在实际应用中，它能让许多计算变得非常简单，稍后我会展示给你们看。我想我们已经定义了功或能量的单位。如果你用一牛顿的力移动一米的距离，那就是一焦耳。)

If I have one kilogram of matter, one kilogram of matter, I'm sure, your book probably weighs almost one kilogram. If I raise that book by one meter, how many joules is that? It's mgz. So it's 1 times 9.8 times 1. So it's about 10 joules. So 10 joules is not a very large energy. A person can raise many kilograms, many meters. So to a human being, a joule is not a very large unit. Any questions about the gravitational potential energy? So if I have a body here, I drop it. At the beginning, it has no kinetic energy. If it's at rest, it has no kinetic energy.(如果我有一千克的物质，一千克的物质，我确信，你的书大概也重约一千克。如果我把那本书举高一米，那相当于多少焦耳呢？就是mgz。所以是1乘以9.8乘以1。大概是10焦耳。10焦耳并不是很大的能量。一个人可以举起很多千克，抬高很多米。所以对人类来说，焦耳并不是一个很大的单位。关于重力势能还有什么问题吗？如果我这里有一个物体，我把它放下。开始时它没有动能。如果它是静止的，就没有动能。)

But relative to the floor, it has a large potential energy. If I drop it, it hits the floor. And at which point it has a kinetic energy, it has no more potential energy. So the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in that process. But after a few seconds, it still rests on the floor. So the kinetic energy becomes zero.(但相对于地板，它具有很大的势能。如果我松开它，它会撞击地板。此时它拥有动能，而不再有势能。因此在这个过程中，势能转化为了动能。但几秒钟后，它又静止在地板上。于是动能又变成了零。)

The potential energy also becomes zero. So what happened? Is the energy lost? Yes, the mechanical energy is lost. But as we'll learn later, total energy is conserved. What happens is that it becomes hot. If a body drops down, it would get smashed, break into pieces. But suppose it's a rigid body, it's a piece of iron. It won't break. But what happens is that that kinetic energy is converted into heat. And when people realized about 200 years ago that that heat is, if you do how to convert it, is equal to the kinetic energy that's lost.(势能也变为零。那么发生了什么？能量消失了吗？是的，机械能消失了。但正如我们稍后将学到的，总能量是守恒的。实际情况是它变热了。如果一个物体掉落下来，它会被摔碎，变成碎片。但假设它是一个刚体，比如一块铁，它不会碎裂。但实际情况是，动能转化成了热能。大约200年前，人们意识到，如果你知道如何转换的话，这些热量等于损失的动能。)

Then people realized there's a total energy which is conserved. If you include both the mechanical and the heat energy. And that becomes the first law of thermodynamics. Okay, what we have done in 7.4 is the conservation of energy with a system, with a mechanical system, with the gravity. Now we do something about work done on a spring. If you have a body on ice with no friction, and you tie it to a spring, in a natural state, we take that to be x equal to zero.(于是人们意识到存在一种总能量是守恒的。如果你把机械能和热能都包括在内。这就成了热力学第一定律。好的，我们在7.4节所做的是关于一个系统、一个机械系统、在重力作用下的能量守恒。现在我们讨论一下对弹簧做功的情况。如果你把一个物体放在无摩擦的冰面上，并把它系在一根弹簧上，在自然状态下，我们设x等于零。)

You all have the experience. If you pull on it, it will be, the spring will try to bring it back. If you compress it, the spring will also resist that. In other words, the spring always tries to restore the position of the body to the original position, to the relaxed position, or normal position. So what is the force? This is called Hooke's law. Hooke was a contemporary of Newton.(你们都有这样的经验。如果你拉伸它，弹簧会试图恢复原状；如果你压缩它，弹簧也会产生阻力。换句话说，弹簧总是试图让物体恢复到原来的位置、放松的位置或正常的位置。那么这个力是什么呢？这就是所谓的胡克定律。胡克是牛顿同时代的人。)

In fact, he was a competitor of Newton. He was a distinguished physicist, but he didn't have the mathematical ability of Newton. So he made good contributions, but of course not the earth-shaking contributions like Newton did. Hooke's law says that the force, the force on the body, is equal to minus kx. x is the displacement. If x is positive, that means you are elongating, you are stretching the spring.(事实上，他是牛顿的竞争对手。他是一位杰出的物理学家，但没有牛顿那样的数学能力。因此他做出了不错的贡献，但当然无法像牛顿那样做出惊天动地的成就。胡克定律指出，物体所受的力等于负kx。x代表位移。如果x为正，意味着你在拉长、拉伸弹簧。)

$$\vec{F}=-k \vec{x}=m \frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2}$$

Then the force on the body is negative, so there's a minus sign. On the other hand, if x is negative, then the force on the body is positive. So that's so both cases you have this formula. This K is called a force constant. Now let us apply. We have f is equal to minus kx is equal to m times d. If I multiply this by, I didn't do anything, I rewrote the dt.(那么作用在物体上的力是负的，所以这里有个负号。另一方面，如果x是负的，那么作用在物体上的力就是正的。因此在这两种情况下，你都可以用这个公式。这个K被称为力常数。现在让我们应用一下。我们有f等于负kx等于m乘以d。如果我乘以这个，我什么都没做，我只是重写了dt。)

$$-k \vec{x} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{x}=m \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathrm{dt}=m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\vec{v}) \cdot \vec{v}\, \mathrm{d}t=m \vec{v} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{v}=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{d}(m \cdot \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v})$$

But that is equal to m times d dt of, so it is equal to mv dot. So if I integrate both sides, I get, so I get one half minus k over two times x squared. So if I move them together, I get k over two x squared plus m over two v squared. This is equal to the same thing. Fine. So again, I have conservation energy. In this case, I have a spring energy. The spring energy is equal to this. This is the kinetic energy.(但这等于 m 乘以 d/dt，所以等于 mv 点。因此，如果我对两边进行积分，我得到，我得到 1/2 减去 k/2 乘以 x 的平方。所以如果我把它们合并起来，我得到 k/2 x 的平方加上 m/2 v 的平方。这等于同样的东西。好的。所以，我又有了能量守恒。在这种情况下，我有弹簧势能。弹簧势能等于这个。这是动能。)

$$-k \int \vec{x} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{x}=\frac{m}{2} \int \mathrm{d}(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v})$$
即：

$$-\frac{k}{2}[x^2]^f_{i}=\frac{m}{2}[(v^2)_{f}-(v^2)_{i}]$$

得到：

$$\left(-\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \right)_{f}-\left( -\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \right)_{i}=\left( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \right)_{f}-\left( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \right)_{i}$$
整理有：

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \right)_{i}+\left( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \right)_{i}=
\left(\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \right)_{f}+\left( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \right)_{f}$$

I now have a kinetic, have a potential energy of the spring, and that's equal to k over two x squared. x is the displacement from the normal position. And the kinetic energy plus this potential energy is a constant.(我现在有一个动能，还有一个弹簧的势能，等于k除以2乘以x的平方。x是相对于正常位置的位移。动能加上这个势能是一个常数。)

Just like the kinetic energy plus the gravitational potential energy is a constant if you only have a gravitational force. If you think about this, you can go through this. If a body is subject to both a gravitational force and a spring, then you have three energies. You have total energy, you have kinetic energy, gravitational energy, and spring energy. And the sum of the three should be a constant. Everybody happy? By the way, how about English? Is everybody happy if I speak 100 percent in English? Good.（就像如果只有重力作用时，动能加上重力势能是一个常数。仔细想想，你就能理解这一点。如果一个物体同时受到重力和弹簧力的作用，那么就有三种能量：总能量、动能、重力势能和弹簧势能。这三者之和应该是一个常数。大家都明白了吗？顺便问一下，英语怎么样？如果我百分之百用英语讲课，大家都能听懂吗？很好。）

So we have now learned that for a mechanical system, actually intuition, you know this. For a system which does not have electricity, does not have chemical reactions, does not have tremendous impact, which would create heat, you have a conservation of energy. And you add the kinetic energy to various potential energies, you get a conserved system.  So let us do a sample problem 7-8. The problem is the following. There is a spring in a relaxed state.（因此，我们现在已经了解到，对于一个机械系统来说，实际上凭直觉就能明白这一点。对于一个没有电力、没有化学反应、也不会产生巨大影响（比如产生热量）的系统，能量是守恒的。将动能与各种势能相加，就得到了一个守恒系统。那么，让我们来做例题7-8。题目如下：有一个处于松弛状态的弹簧。）

And here comes a body which moves with a velocity is equal to 0.5 meters per second. Of course it would compress the spring. And the spring has a k equal to, the spring is equal to 750 newtons per meter. The spring coefficient, what did the book call it? Force constant. The force constant, the dimension of the force constant is obviously newton divided by distance. So it's newton per meter.（这时有一个物体以每秒0.5米的速度移动。当然它会压缩弹簧。这个弹簧的k值等于——弹簧系数是750牛顿每米。这个弹簧系数，书上是怎么称呼的？力常数。力常数的量纲显然是牛顿除以距离，所以单位是牛顿每米。）

The question is how much does it compress it? So let us use the conservation of energy. Initially, initial energy is equal to kinetic energy, which is one half mv squared plus 0. At the beginning, and final energy is equal to zero. Finally, the body stops, so it's equal to zero plus one-half of k x squared. x is the displacement. （问题是它能压缩多少？让我们用能量守恒定律来解决。初始能量等于动能，即1/2 mv²，加上0。开始时，最终能量等于零。最终，物体停止运动，所以等于零加上1/2 kx²。x是位移。）

用能量守恒方法来做：初始时，总能量是 动能（$\frac{1}{2}mv^2$），弹性势能为 0，结束时，运动停止，动能是 0，弹性势能是 $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$

So therefore, x squared is equal to m v squared divided by k. It's equal to, oh, we forgot that m was given, is 0.40 kilograms. So this is 0.40 kilograms times k is 750 newton per meter. v squared is 0.5 squared times meter squared second squared. (因此，x的平方等于m乘以v的平方除以k。等于，哦，我们忘了m的值是0.40千克。所以这是0.40千克乘以k等于750牛顿每米。v的平方是0.5的平方乘以米平方每秒平方。)

Is the dimension correct? The newton per meter is equal to kilogram meter per second squared times, divide by meter. So meter squared divided by meter squared, kilogram. Is that correct? Something's wrong.  Newton per meter. Newton is kilogram times acceleration times meter squared. That's correct. (尺寸正确吗？牛顿每米等于千克米每秒平方乘以，除以米。所以米平方除以米平方，千克。这样对吗？好像有点问题。牛顿每米。牛顿是千克乘以加速度乘以米平方。这是正确的。)

Divide by meter. Something's wrong. Does anybody know what's wrong? Let me see.  This is v squared, m v squared. m is here, v squared is here. That's correct.  Divide by k. It's newton per meter. That's correct. And newton is kilogram times acceleration.  That's correct. Divide by meter. Oh, correct.  There's nothing wrong. So this s squared cancels this s squared. This meter cancels this. (除以米。有点不对劲。有人知道哪里出错了吗？让我看看。这是v的平方，m乘以v的平方。m在这里，v的平方在这里。没错。除以k。单位是牛顿每米。没错。而牛顿等于千克乘以加速度。没错。除以米。哦，对了。没什么问题。所以这个秒的平方和这个秒的平方抵消了。这个米和这个抵消了。)

So this gets, we get 0.40 times 0.5 squared times 750 meter squared. And if you compute that, then you get x. x turns out to be 1.2 centimeters.(所以我们得到的是0.40乘以0.5的平方再乘以750米的平方。计算一下，结果是x。x算出来是1.2厘米。)

In general, when you talk about a motion like this, if you write it down as a differential equation, the energy equation has only time derivative in it, right? The energy equation has one half of mv squared, mv squared is the time derivative. But the force equation has the second derivative, energy equation has ddt in it, force equation has d squared dt in it. In other words, the energy equation is an integrated force equation.（一般来说，当你讨论这样的运动时，如果用微分方程表示，能量方程中只包含时间导数，对吧？能量方程中有½mv²，mv²就是时间导数。而力方程包含二阶导数，能量方程中是d/dt，力方程中则是d²/dt²。换句话说，能量方程就是力方程的积分形式。）

*能量方程中含有 $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}$；而力的方程中含有 $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}$；换句话说，能量方程就是力方程的积分形式。*

In fact, that's how we got it. The way we got those conservation laws were always you write down the force equation and integrate dt and you get the energy equation. So the energy equation is always the integral of the force equation, which therefore is one step closer to answer.（事实上，我们就是这样得到它的。我们得到这些守恒定律的方式总是这样的：写下力的方程，对时间积分，就得到了能量方程。所以能量方程总是力方程的积分，因此离答案更近了一步。）

So energy equation is the integrated form of the force equation. So if you can use the energy equation, it's always simpler. You have already done the integration once. Next we'll talk about power. We have talked about work. Work is related to the increase of kinetic energy. Now you can see if I try to stop something, I do some negative work on it, or the body does some work on me. And there's a rate of work. So power is defined to be the rate of work done.（能量方程是力方程的积分形式。因此，如果能使用能量方程，问题总会更简单。因为你已经完成了一次积分运算。接下来我们将讨论功率。我们已经讨论过功的概念——功与动能的增加相关。现在你可以看到，如果我试图让某物体停止运动，我就对它做了负功，或者说物体对我做了功。而功是有速率的，因此功率被定义为做功的速率。）

$$p= \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}=\vec{F} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

It could be positive or negative. So it is equal to f dot dx dt. So what is this dimension? It's unit, unit of power. It's called watt. Watt is equal to joule per second. W is in units of joule, joule per second. It's also in terms of Newton, Newton times meter per second, Newton times velocity. And it's called watt. Now watt is something that we are very familiar with because we have a bulb which is 50 watts.(它可能是正的，也可能是负的。所以它等于f点乘dx dt。那么这个量纲是什么？它的单位，功率的单位。叫做瓦特。瓦特等于焦耳每秒。W的单位是焦耳，焦耳每秒。也可以用牛顿表示，牛顿乘以米每秒，牛顿乘以速度。这就叫瓦特。现在我们非常熟悉瓦特这个概念，因为我们有50瓦的灯泡。)

Or you have a burner in the kitchen which is, say, 1,000 watts. We have oftentimes a unit of kilowatt hour. If you pay your electricity bill, you know the kilowatt water. It's called kilowatt hour. A kilowatt hour in America is typically 1 US, 10 US cents, one-tenth of a dollar. In other words, if you burn a, if you burn a 100-watt bulb, 10 hours, you have 1 kilowatt hour, and in America you would pay about 10 cents.(或者厨房里有一个功率为1000瓦的炉灶。我们经常使用千瓦时这个单位。如果你付过电费，就会知道千瓦时。在美国，一千瓦时通常花费10美分，也就是一美元的十分之一。换句话说，如果你使用一个100瓦的灯泡，持续10小时，就消耗了1千瓦时，在美国大约需要支付10美分。)

I think in China it's lower. This is actually a very important issue, how much China charges energy. And because that determines the, in some sense, the rate of expansion of Chinese business.(我认为中国的电价更低。这实际上是一个非常重要的问题，即中国的能源定价。因为这在某种程度上决定了中国企业的扩张速度。)

If the Chinese government wants to deflate, wants to have fewer economic activities, one of the things that the Chinese government could do is to raise the price of electricity. If they raise the price of electricity, then everybody has to be more careful, including the manufacturers. And so that's a very efficient way of deflating.（如果中国政府想要抑制通胀，减少经济活动，他们可以采取的措施之一就是提高电价。一旦电价上涨，包括制造商在内的所有人都必须更加谨慎。因此，这是一种非常有效的抑制通胀的方式。）

But because of that, it's a very powerful economic policy. So therefore, one should use it with great care. One kilowatt hour is equal to 10 to the third watts times 3600 seconds. So it's 3.6 times 10 to the sixth joules. That again shows that joule is a rather small unit. A kilowatt hour is the kind of energy that we oftentimes use, and it's equal to almost 4 million joules.（但正因如此，这是一项极具影响力的经济政策。因此，使用时必须格外谨慎。一千瓦时等于10的3次方瓦乘以3600秒，也就是3.6乘以10的6次方焦耳。这再次表明焦耳是个相当小的单位。我们日常使用的千瓦时能量单位，几乎相当于400万焦耳。）

In the old days, one sometimes uses horsepower. One horsepower today is defined to be 746 watts. Let's do some exercises. Let's take chapter 7, question 11. There's this diagram. There's a frictionless surface on which rests the body, and the body is tied to two springs, one on each side.（在过去，人们有时会使用马力。如今，一马力被定义为746瓦。让我们做一些练习。以第7章第11题为例。图中有一个无摩擦表面，上面放置着一个物体，物体两侧各系着一根弹簧。）

But when in this position, the two springs are both at rest, no forces. The problem is to ask, what happens if I move this by x? What is the force on it? It's a trivial problem. If x is positive, then minus kx is the force on the first of the spring on the right.（但在这种状态下，两个弹簧都处于静止状态，没有受力。问题是，如果我把它移动x距离会发生什么？作用在它上面的力是多少？这是一个简单的问题。如果x是正值，那么第一个弹簧（右侧）上的力就是负kx。）

So you get force is equal to minus kx because of the spring on the right. The spring on the left, the force is also minus kx, so it's equal to minus 2kx. And that's true if k is negative, if x is negative, right? If x is negative, both springs want to pull it back this way, so you get the minus 2kx, which is positive.（因此，由于右侧弹簧的作用，你得到力等于负kx。左侧弹簧的力也是负kx，所以总力等于负2kx。如果k为负、x为负，这个结论也成立，对吧？如果x为负，两个弹簧都想把它拉回这个方向，所以你会得到负2kx，这个值是正的。）

B, what is the energy? Well, each spring has an energy of one half kx squared. So energy, potential energy, is equal to 2 times one half kx squared. Here it talks about a different kind of energy. It's an energy due to a motion, for example, the resistance we talked about last time. There's air friction. Suppose the air friction, suppose the force is proportional to the velocity.（B，什么是能量？嗯，每个弹簧的能量是二分之一kx平方。所以能量，势能，等于2乘以二分之一kx平方。这里讨论的是另一种能量。这是一种由于运动而产生的能量，比如我们上次谈到的阻力。有空气摩擦力。假设空气摩擦力，假设力与速度成正比。）

Suppose friction in air or in water is proportional to velocity. The friction matter is an extremely complicated thing. It depends on the shape of the body, and it depends on the property of the liquid or the gas.（假设空气或水中的摩擦力与速度成正比。摩擦力是一个非常复杂的问题。它取决于物体的形状，也取决于液体或气体的性质。）

So this is just purely a hypothesis. If the velocity, if the friction, if the air friction is proportional to velocity, the question is how about the power? If that is the case, force is proportional to v. Power is F dot v and is proportional to v squared. So therefore, if v increases by a factor of 2, the power increases by a factor of 4. But this is, in general, not necessarily correct.（所以这纯粹只是一个假设。如果速度，如果摩擦力，如果空气摩擦力与速度成正比，那么问题是功率会怎样？如果是这种情况，力与速度v成正比。功率是F点乘v，与v的平方成正比。因此，如果v增加2倍，功率就会增加4倍。但这在一般情况下并不一定正确。）

It also depends on what the velocity is. You all know that if an airplane flies too fast, it could become supersonic. And when it becomes supersonic, it's a completely different game. So air resistance or water resistance is an extremely complicated matter. This is just an exercise. Now let us go back to our old friend, the swing. We have talked about a swing, so let's say there are two forces on the swing, on the object. And that force, one is this force, the other is the tension on the rope. Now this you can resolve into two.（这也取决于速度的大小。你们都知道，如果飞机飞得太快，可能会达到超音速。而一旦达到超音速，情况就完全不同了。所以空气阻力或水的阻力是一个非常复杂的问题。这只是一个练习。现在让我们回到我们的老朋友——秋千。我们已经讨论过秋千，假设秋千上，也就是物体上，有两个力。其中一个力是这个力，另一个是绳子上的张力。现在你可以把它分解成两个力。）

So what is the force, total force, on the body in the direction of, in the direction perpendicular, in the tangent direction? Namely, in this direction. This force, T, does not have a component in that direction. And the mg has this component, which is not in that direction, but there is a component in here.（那么，在垂直于该方向的方向上，在切线方向上，物体所受的总力是什么呢？也就是说，在这个方向上。这个力T在该方向上没有分量。而mg有这个分量，它不在那个方向上，但这里有一个分量。）

And since this is theta, so it's mg sine theta. However, for positive, for theta increasing, it goes this way, so there's a negative sign. So total force on body in the tangent direction is equal to minus g sine theta. Now we had a formula last time, what I'm discussing we already did last time, so I'm just repeating it. We had a formula for a body moving this way, where r is a constant. The swing motion r is a constant.（既然这是θ角，那么它就是mg sinθ。然而，当 θ 为正且增大时，物体朝这个方向运动，所以这里有个负号。因此，物体在切线方向上的总受力等于负g sinθ。上次我们推导过一个公式——我现在讨论的内容其实上次已经讲过了，这里只是重复一遍。对于沿这个方向运动的物体（其中 r 为常量），我们得出过一个公式。在摆动运动中，r 是恒定不变的。）

Then the acceleration in the tangent direction, in the theta increasing direction, is r theta double dot. Therefore, r theta double dot times m, that's m times the acceleration at, is equal to minus mg sine theta. We already had this formula last time. So therefore, theta double dot is equal to minus g over r sine theta. This is the force equation. This is the equation that we obtained by using the force.（那么，在切线方向上，即 θ 增加的方向上，加速度为 $r \ddot{\theta}$。因此，rθ双点乘以m，即m乘以at处的加速度，等于负的mg sinθ。我们上次已经得到了这个公式。因此，θ双点等于负的g除以r乘以sinθ。这就是力的方程。这是我们通过使用力得到的方程。）
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\theta}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\frac{g}{r} \sin \theta$$
And it contains the second derivative with respect to time. Now instead of that, let us write down the energy equation. Energy equation says the kinetic energy, the product is moving, it has only a velocity along the tangent direction, which is r theta dot.(它包含对时间的二阶导数。现在，我们不这样做，而是写下能量方程。能量方程表示动能，即物体运动时的能量，它只有沿切线方向的速度，即rθ点。)

$$\text{动量} = \frac{1}{2}m(r \dot{\theta})^2$$
把秋千的最低点位置作为势能为 0 的地方，则某点的势能为：$$\begin{align}
\text{势能}&=mg(r-r \cos \theta)\\ \\
\text{总能量}&=E=\frac{1}{2}m(r \dot{\theta})^2+mg(r-r \cos \theta)
\end{align}$$

So therefore, kinetic energy is equal to one half of m theta dot, m r theta dot squared. And potential energy, potential energy is, this is theta. This is r. So let us calculate what is, let's take this point to be the zero for z. So what is the, what is this distance? It's equal to mg times this distance.(因此，动能等于二分之一乘以m乘以θ点，m乘以r乘以θ点的平方。而势能，势能是，这是θ。这是r。那么让我们来计算一下，让我们把这个点作为z的零点。那么这个距离是多少？它等于mg乘以这个距离。)

We take this to be origin. So it's equal to r minus r cosine theta. So the energy equation says one half m r squared theta dot squared plus mg r one minus cosine theta is equal to a constant. It's equal to total energy. So I got one half of theta dot squared plus g over r. If I divide this by m and divide this by r squared g over times one minus cosine theta, this is equal to e divided by m r squared, which is a constant. This is the energy equation.(我们以此作为原点。所以它等于 r 减去 r 乘以余弦 theta。因此，能量方程表示为：1/2 m r² θ̇² + mg r (1 - cosθ) 等于一个常数，即总能量。于是我们得到 1/2 θ̇² + g/r。如果我将这个除以 m，再除以 r² g 乘以 (1 - cosθ)，结果等于 e 除以 m r²，这是一个常数。这就是能量方程。)

$$\frac{E}{mr^2}=\frac{1}{2} \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{g}{r}(1-\cos \theta)$$
对 $\theta$ 求导，可得：$$0=\ddot{\theta}+\frac{g}{r} \sin \theta$$
这再次说明 *能量方程就是力方程的积分形式*

This equation is the same as this equation. If I take the derivative, I immediately get that equation. Then you can do this as an exercise. So that explicitly shows that this energy equation is an integrated form of the, of the, of the force equation. All the rest are constants. So let, let us write it this way.(这个方程与这个方程相同。如果我求导，立刻就能得到那个方程。然后你可以把它当作一个练习来做。这明确地表明，这个能量方程是力方程的积分形式。其余的都是常数。所以，让我们这样写吧。)

回到这个式子中，
$$\frac{E}{mr^2}=\frac{1}{2} \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{g}{r}(1-\cos \theta)$$
稍加整理，可以将其写成：$$\dot{\theta}^2=A+B \cos \theta$$的形式，其中 $A,B$ 都是个常数，假设秋千在达到最高点时速度为 0，此时的角度为 $\theta_{0}$，即当 $\theta=\theta_{0}$ 时，$\dot{\theta}=0$。则在最高点位置上，有：$$0=A+B \cos \theta_{0}$$可解出 $A=-B\cos \theta_{0}$，代入原式有：$$\dot{\theta}^2=B(\cos \theta-\cos \theta_{0})$$从而得到：$$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}=\sqrt{ B } \sqrt{ \cos \theta-\cos \theta_{0} }$$
We move everybody on the right hand side. So it becomes a plus b cosine theta. a is a numerical constant, b is a numerical constant. Now suppose the swing is such that its velocity is zero when it reaches the top. Let's call that point theta zero. Suppose at this point theta zero, if theta dot is equal to zero when theta is equal to theta zero, theta zero is the value of theta where the swing stops.（我们把右边的所有项都移过去。于是就得到了a加b乘以cosθ。a是一个数值常数，b也是一个数值常数。现在假设秋千在到达最高点时速度为零。我们把那个点称为θ零。假设在θ零这一点，如果θ点等于零当θ等于θ零时，θ零就是秋千停止时的θ值。）

So that condition is theta dot equal to zero when theta is equal to zero. So I substitute that in there. Then I get zero is equal to a plus b cosine theta zero. I solve that for a. So therefore I get theta dot squared is equal to b times cosine theta minus cosine theta zero. This you can write as a differential equation. d theta dt is equal to square root of b times square root of cosine theta minus cosine theta zero.（所以当θ等于零时，条件就是θ点等于零。于是我把这个条件代入进去。然后我得到零等于a加上b乘以cosθ零。我解这个方程求a。因此我得到θ点平方等于b乘以（cosθ减去cosθ零）。这个你可以写成一个微分方程。dθ/dt等于根号b乘以根号（cosθ减去cosθ零）。）

I move that, so I get d theta over square root of cosine theta minus cosine theta zero is equal to square root of b integral dt, which is equal to square root of b times t minus a constant. This you can find in, I don't know what they say in appendix e, but this is a standard integral. However, this standard integral is not in terms of a function which is well known.(我提议，因此我得到dθ除以√(cosθ - cosθ₀)等于√b乘以dt的积分，即等于√b乘以t减去一个常数。这个你可以在，我不知道他们怎么说的附录e中找到，但这是一个标准积分。不过，这个标准积分并不是以众所周知的函数形式给出的。)

根据上式，可以有：$$\int \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\sqrt{ \cos \theta-\cos \theta_{0} }}=\sqrt{ B } \int \mathrm{d}t=\sqrt{ B }(t-t_{0})$$So now let us do an approximation. We do an approximation by assuming theta a small oscillation, in other words like a small oscillation. Mathematically, it means theta is small. Small compared to what? Small compared to radian one. One is a radian. One radian is about 60 degrees. So theta is 5 degrees. Theta is not more than 5 degrees. So in this situation, you can change the formula.(那么现在让我们做一个近似。我们通过假设θ是一个小摆动来进行近似，换句话说，就像一个小摆动。数学上，这意味着θ很小。小到什么程度呢？远远小于1弧度。1弧度大约是60度。所以θ是5度。θ不超过5度。在这种情况下，你可以改变公式。)

近似计算：小的弧度 $\theta \ll 1$

对于力的方程：$$\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{r} \sin \theta=-\frac{g}{r}\theta$$因为 $\sin \theta=\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{6}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!}+\cdots$

什么函数的两次导数又回到了它自身，还带个负号？是 Sinusoidal

所以 $$\theta=A_{1}\cos \theta + B_{1} \sin \theta$$
For example, let us use the force equation. Force equation becomes theta double dot is equal to minus c over sine theta. That was what I was talking about. If theta is small, you can expand theta into a power series. So it becomes minus b over r theta because sine theta is equal. The formula is sine theta minus theta cubed over 6 plus theta fifth over 5 factorial minus.（例如，我们使用力的方程。力的方程变为θ的二阶导数等于负c除以sinθ。这就是我之前所说的。如果θ很小，你可以将θ展开成幂级数。因此，它变为负b除以r乘以θ，因为sinθ等于。公式是sinθ减去θ的三次方除以6加上θ的五次方除以5的阶乘减去。）

This formula is pretty good. For example, 1 over 6 is also a small number. Then this is cubed. So if theta is one tenth, then theta squared is 1 over 600. So when theta is small, this is a very good approximation. If that is the case, we have the equation theta double dot is equal to constant times theta.(这个公式相当不错。例如，1除以6也是一个很小的数字。然后这个数字被立方。所以如果θ是十分之一，那么θ的平方就是1除以600。因此，当θ很小时，这是一个非常好的近似值。如果是这样的话，我们得到的方程是θ的双点等于常数乘以θ。)

This equation is a sinusoidal function. Sinusoidal is a sine or a cosine. You differentiate the sine and it becomes a cosine. You differentiate it again and it becomes a cosine. So it is really the original. You differentiate a cosine and it becomes a negative sine.(这个方程是一个正弦函数。正弦指的是正弦或余弦函数。对正弦函数求导会得到余弦函数，再求导一次又变回余弦函数。所以它本质上就是原来的函数。对余弦函数求导会得到负的正弦函数。)

You differentiate it again and it becomes a negative cosine. So whether it is a sine or a cosine or a linear combination, a cosine theta plus b sine theta. You differentiate it twice and it becomes a negative original. So this is a typical one. So theta is equal to sinusoidal. So theta is equal to a cosine theta.（再对它求导，就变成了负余弦。所以无论是正弦、余弦还是它们的线性组合，a cosθ + b sinθ。对它求两次导，就会变成负的原函数。所以这是一个典型的例子。因此θ等于正弦函数。所以θ等于a cosθ。）

This a has nothing to do with the constant a. This is a1 plus b1 sine theta. We used the force equation just now. Let's look at the energy in this approximation. We have already written the energy just now. Potential energy. Mgr 1 minus cosine theta. Bottom part. Mgz. We just had sine theta.(这与常数a无关。这是a1加b1乘以sinθ。我们刚才用了力的方程。现在看看在这种近似下的能量。我们刚才已经写出了能量。势能。Mgr乘以（1减去cosθ）。底部部分。Mgz。我们刚才有sinθ。)

上面是通过力的方程，接下来我们通过能量的方程：

势能：$\text{PE}=mgr(1-\cos \theta)=mgr\left( \frac{\theta^2}{2} \right)$

其中 $\cos \theta=1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}-\cdots$



Cosine theta has a similar formula. Cosine theta is equal to 1 minus theta squared over 2 plus theta fourth over 24. Why do I remember this formula? These formulas all come from an exponential formula of e to the i theta. e to the i theta. We will come back to this later. Anyway.You have Mgr 1 minus cosine theta to be theta squared over 2 approximately. The potential energy is equal to the quadratic. This is exactly the same as the spring just now.(余弦θ有一个类似的公式。余弦θ等于1减去θ的平方除以2，再加上θ的四次方除以24。为什么我记得这个公式？这些公式都来自于e的iθ次方的指数公式。e的iθ次方。我们稍后会再回到这个话题。总之。你有 Mgr 1 减去余弦 theta 约等于 theta 平方除以 2。势能等于二次项。这与刚才的弹簧完全一样。)

The velocity of the spring, the kinetic energy of the spring is x dot squared. Its potential energy is proportional to x squared. Now the kinetic energy is proportional to theta dot squared. Potential energy is proportional to theta squared. So the mathematics is exactly the same. This kind of mathematics is typically a sinusoid. Because if the potential energy is like this, its derivative becomes the force law.（*弹簧的速度，弹簧的动能是x点平方。其势能与x平方成正比。现在动能与θ点平方成正比。势能与θ平方成正比*。因此数学上完全相同。这种数学通常表现为正弦曲线。因为如果势能是这样，它的导数就变成了力的定律。）

~~I will discuss this in more detail later. Let's discuss another problem, a general problem. This is a slide, a complicated slide. This is x axis. Let's consider a frictionless slide. So you have a body here. It moves here. It has a kinetic energy. It has a potential energy. As I said before, you can take any value of z as its origin. So if I write down the energy equation, this is Mgz. But z is a function of x. The book calls this u of x. The book calls this u of x as a function of x. This kind of problem is common in physics.（稍后我会更详细地讨论这个问题。现在让我们讨论另一个问题，一个普遍的问题。这是一张幻灯片，一张复杂的幻灯片。这是x轴。让我们考虑一个无摩擦的滑道。这里有一个物体。它移动到这里。它具有动能。它具有势能。正如我之前所说，你可以选择任何z值作为原点。因此，如果我写下能量方程，这是Mgz。但z是x的函数。书中称这个为u(x)。书中称这个u(x)是x的函数。这类问题在物理学中很常见。）~~

~~So we talk about it as a slide, but it actually works in general. Sorry, let me think. I made a mistake. It can't be a slide. Because the particle of a slide... You forgot what I just said. It's like this. What I want to talk about is a general potential energy. But when I was preparing last night, I said it was like a slide. I talked about half of it, and I knew it was wrong. So you forgot what I just said. （所以我们把它比作滑梯，但其实它适用于一般情况。抱歉，让我想想。我说错了。它不可能是滑梯。因为滑梯的粒子...你忘了我刚才说的。是这样的。我想讨论的是一个普遍的势能。但昨晚准备时，我说它像滑梯。讲到一半时，我就知道错了。所以你们忘了我刚才说的。）~~


So let's start over. We just talked about a spring.The energy of this spring is 1 half kx squared. But your spring is not a regular spring. Its energy is not like that. As a matter of fact, a real spring's energy is not strictly 1 half of kx squared. So I'm going to talk about a general potential energy. Let's assume this is x. x is a displacement. And this force is a function of x. Is it possible to do this? If you want to do it, you can do it. If you do this to a regular spring, it won't move around. But for our discussion, let us assume you can do this.（让我们重新开始。我们刚才讨论的是弹簧。这个弹簧的能量是1/2kx²。但你的弹簧并非普通弹簧，其能量并非如此。事实上，真实弹簧的能量并不严格等于1/2kx²。因此我将讨论广义势能。假设这是x，x代表位移。而这个力是x的函数。这样的力能做到吗？一定要这么做的话是可以做得到的。通常的弹簧，一般不会这样拱来拱去的。但为了便于讨论，我们姑且假设你能实现这种操作。）

![[7.png|300]]

$U(x)$ 是广义势能，所以：$U(x)+\frac{1}{2}m \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)^2=E$，对时间求导，$$\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}x} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}+m \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0$$
消掉 $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$，得到$$\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}x} +m \frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0$$这就是想要的函数。

So under this condition, we have to say that its total energy is u of x plus 1 half of m dx dt squared is equal to a constant. This is its energy equation. If I take this equation as a derivative with respect to time, what is d dt of u of x? It's du dx times dx dt. This differential becomes m dx dt times d squared x dt squared. If I subtract dx dt, it becomes m d squared x dt squared is equal to du dx. This is the function I want.（因此，在这种条件下，我们必须说它的总能量是u(x)加上1/2 m(dx/dt)^2等于一个常数。这就是它的能量方程。如果我对这个方程关于时间求导，那么u(x)关于时间的导数d/dt[u(x)]是什么呢？它是du/dx乘以dx/dt。这个微分变成了m(dx/dt)(d²x/dt²)。如果我消去dx/dt，就得到m(d²x/dt²)等于-du/dx。这就是我想要的函数。）

What does this mean? m times d squared x dt squared is of course force. So force is equal to this. In other words, force is equal to du dx. This is what I want. So I repeat. If there is a spring or a complicated gadget, its potential energy is like this. So in this spring, at each time, for example, it's here. Its force is negative du dx. Here, it's also du dx.（这是什么意思？m乘以d²x/dt²当然就是力。所以力等于这个。*换句话说，力等于 -du/dx。这就是我想要的*。所以我再重复一遍。如果有一个弹簧或一个复杂的装置，它的势能是这样的。所以在这个弹簧中，比如说，它在这里的时候。它的力是负的du/dx。在这里，也是du/dx。）

For example, if the potential energy is 1 half kx squared, then you take the derivative down to the minus kx which is what we got before. In other words, this is just a more general case. Did you have any questions? Okay, after you understand this, I'll go back to the previous picture. This means that at this point, du dx is equal to zero. So at this point, it doesn't move. There is no force.（例如，如果势能是1/2kx²，那么求导得到-kx，这与我们之前的结果一致。换句话说，这只是一个更普遍的情况。你们有什么问题吗？好的，理解了这一点后，我将回到之前的图示。这意味着在这一点上，du/dx等于零。因此，在这一点上，物体不会移动。没有力的作用。）

*所以在上面的图中，各个拐点处，导数为零，也就是那些拐点处是没有力的，这些点被称为平衡点，* 但是在低洼处的点是稳定平衡点，而在凸起处的点是不稳定平衡点。为什么？

例如，在低洼处的附近动一动，比如稍微往右动一动，则 $U(x)$ 斜率是正的，所以力是负的，让其归位于低洼处，而稍微往左动一动，$U(x)$ 斜率是负的，力是正的，也将使其归位于低洼处；反之，如果在凸起处，例如稍微往右动一动，斜率是负的，力是正的，结果往右跑得更远了。


At this point, there is no force. At this point, there is no force. So these points where du dx is equal to zero are called equilibrium points. This point is called stable equilibrium. This point is called unstable equilibrium. Why is it called unstable equilibrium? If you move it a little bit, move it back and forth, for example, if you move it here, its slope is true, but the previous one is not.（此时没有力。此时没有力。因此，du dx 等于零的这些点被称为平衡点。这个点被称为稳定平衡。这个点被称为不稳定平衡。为什么它被称为不稳定平衡？如果你稍微移动它，来回移动，例如，如果你把它移到这里，它的斜率是正确的，但前一个不是。）

So the force pushes it back. At this point, du dx is negative, but the negative du dx is positive. So it pushes it inside. So people around here are called ultimate. But at this point, if you move it a little bit, it keeps moving. So this is unstable equilibrium. This is stable equilibrium. But more than that, if the U is like this, you don't care about anything else. We just talked about when it's displaced slightly to the right, it will push back to the left and vice versa.（因此，力会将其推回。此时，du/dx为负值，但负的du/dx实际上是正值，所以会将其向内推。这里的人们被称为终极者。但在这一点上，如果你稍微移动它，它就会继续移动。所以这是不稳定平衡。这是稳定平衡。不仅如此，如果势能U是这样的，你就不用担心其他任何情况。我们刚刚讨论的是当它稍微向右偏移时，它会向左推回，反之亦然。）

Now, a curve around a point near a stable equilibrium, the U curve can be approximated by a parabola. Why? You can expand it around here. Usually a smooth curve can be expanded as a power series. If you use this point as x equals 0, it can be expanded as a power series. It's a plus bx plus cx squared plus dx. If the slope is equal to 0, then bx must be equal to 0. Because its derivative at x equals 0 is b. So its derivative must be equal to 0. So it starts with a quadratic term.（现在，*围绕稳定平衡点附近的曲线，U形曲线可以用抛物线近似表示*。为什么呢？你可以在这里展开它。通常，一条平滑的曲线可以展开为幂级数。如果你用这个点作为x等于0，它可以展开为幂级数。它是a加bx加cx平方加dx立方等。如果斜率等于0，那么bx必须等于0。因为它在x等于0处的导数是b。所以它的导数必须等于0。因此，它从二次项开始。）

一个平滑曲线可以表示为 $a+bx+cx^2+dx^3+\cdots$ ，由于在平衡点位置的斜率为 0，所以 $b=0$，所以等价于说在这附近一点，可以表示为 $a+b \Delta x+c (\Delta x)^2$，所以忽略掉常数项和 $b$ 项，势能是与 $(\Delta x)^2$ 的平方成正比的。

In other words, near this point, the most common phenomenon is a plus bx plus delta x squared. This constant is not very important. If it's near this point, if you neglect the rest of it, then you get the potential energy is proportional to delta x squared. And therefore its force is minus its derivative is proportional to x. So what's the conclusion? （换句话说，在这一点附近，最常见的现象是a加bx加Δx的平方。这个常数并不太重要。如果在这一点附近，如果你忽略其余部分，那么*势能与Δx的平方成正比。因此，其力（即负导数）与x成正比*。那么结论是什么呢？）

The conclusion is as long as you are near an equilibrium point, as long as the quadratic this is called a quadratic approximation, approximated by a parabola to a quadratic approximation, as long as you can make such a quadratic approximation, it's a sinusoidal wave. Because it's equivalent to a string. Curves can be approximated.（*结论是，只要你在平衡点附近，只要这个二次项——这被称为二次近似，用抛物线逼近的二次近似，只要你能做出这样的二次近似，它就是一个正弦波。因为它相当于一根弦。曲线是可以被近似的。*）

Therefore, the motion, the motion is like a string vibration. i.e., it is sinusoidal. I only wanted to say all small vibrations are approximately sinusoidal. That is why the string motion is so important. For a for a real string, the the motion is a very well described by a sinusoidal wave. But what I'm saying is that for all small vibrations, a good approximation is sinusoidal. That is the reason why in physics, sinusoidal motions are so important. OK. Have a good long holiday, and we'll be back after the holidays. Oh, Saturday the 9th, Professor Ruan or Professor An will take over.（*因此，运动就像弦的振动一样，即它是正弦的。我只想说所有的小振动都近似于正弦。这就是为什么弦的运动如此重要。对于一根真实的弦，其运动可以用正弦波很好地描述。但我要说的是，对于所有的小振动，一个很好的近似就是正弦的。这就是为什么在物理学中，正弦运动如此重要。* 好了，祝大家长假愉快，假期后我们再见。哦，9号星期六，将由阮教授或安教授代课。）
