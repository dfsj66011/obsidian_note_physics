Today I'm going to talk about Chapter 9. Chapter 9 is mainly about the Center of Mass. These are all extremely important concepts. First, we need to define central mass. There are two different definitions for this kind of quantum mechanics. One is the geometric definition. The other is the unidirectional definition. You can prove that these two definitions are the same.（今天我要讲的是第九章。第九章主要讲的是质心。这些都是极其重要的概念。首先，我们需要定义质心。这种情形之下，有两种不同的定义。一种是几何定义。另一种是代数定义。你可以证明这两种定义是相同的。）

$$\vec{r}_{\text{com}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \vec{r}_i,$$

Today, we will use the unidirectional definition. Let's say there are many particles. Their mass is m i, and their coordinate is r i. Given a coordinate system, there are many r i and m i. So, if we sum up m i, r i, and divide by the total mass, we get the central mass, the coordinate. For example, if there are three particles, we get the central mass. This definition is very simple. If there are only two particles, in one-dimension, we know that one particle is heavy and the other is light.（今天我们将使用代数定义。假设有很多粒子，它们的质量为 $m_i$，坐标为 $r_i$。给定一个坐标系，会有许多 $r_i$ 和 $m_i$。因此，如果我们把 $m_i$ 和 $r_i$ 相乘，再除以总质量，就能得到质心坐标。例如，如果有三个粒子，我们就能得到质心。这个定义非常简单。如果只有两个粒子，在一维情况下，我们知道一个粒子较重，另一个较轻。）

If we divide by the two particles, in one-dimension, we get m 1 x 1 plus m 2 x 2 divided by m 1 plus m 2. This is the central mass, the x-central mass. For example, if m 1 and m 2 are equal, this is 1, and m 2 is 2. Then, m 1 and m 2 are obvious. Because 2 has a bigger weight, so it is in one-third place. The central mass is here. I think the intuition is very simple. So, this is a more general definition.(如果我们将两个粒子在一维空间中进行划分，会得到(m₁x₁ + m₂x₂)/(m₁ + m₂)。这就是质心位置，即x方向的质心坐标。举个例子，假设m₁=1，m₂=2（显然m₂质量更大）。由于第二个粒子质量更大，质心会偏向它三分之一的位置。质心就在这里。我认为这个原理非常直观。因此，这是一个更具普适性的定义。)

In this definition, the first one is the theorem. The r-central mass, so defined, is independent of the choice of coordinate system. In general, an algebra is defined as a central mass. However, there are three particles. They are defined as a central mass. I used a coordinate system. If I use another coordinate system, is it still the same central mass? The theorem says yes. But it needs a proof. This book is very vague.(在这个定义中，第一条是定理。如此定义的 r 中心质量，与坐标系的选择无关。一般来说，代数被定义为一个中心质量。然而，这里存在三个粒子。它们被定义为一个中心质量。我使用了一个坐标系。如果我使用另一个坐标系，它仍然是同一个中心质量吗？定理说答案是肯定的。但这需要一个证明。这本书说得非常含糊。)

I found that the purpose of this book is to make it easy for everyone to understand. But I hope everyone can understand that there are some sensitive points. This proof is actually very simple. If you take a coordinate system, and I take another coordinate system, it is a displacement. Change of axis by displacement. By displacement, you move the axis parallel. But you change the origin. So, if you move the coordinate axis parallel, and change the axis, then we ask, what is the RRI? I call it RRI prime. RRI prime is RRI plus displacement.(我发现这本书的目的是为了让每个人都能轻松理解。但我希望大家能明白其中有一些敏感点。这个证明其实非常简单。如果你取一个坐标系，我取另一个坐标系，这就是一个位移。通过位移改变坐标轴。通过位移，你可以平行移动坐标轴。但你会改变原点。所以，如果你平行移动坐标轴并改变坐标轴，那么我们问，RI是什么？我称之为RI撇。RI撇等于RI加上位移。)
$$\vec{r}^\prime = \vec{r} + \vec{d}$$

So, RRI prime is RRI plus a fixed displacement. This fixed displacement is the axis of these two coordinates. The coordinates are moving from here to here. If this is... If this is... This is R. This is the original axis, XY. This is X prime, Y prime. So, this displacement... It is obvious that... Let me see.  RRI prime is upside down. This is... Sorry. This is the original axis. This is... The fixed point is here. This is R. This is R prime. It is obvious that R prime is R plus D. So, this is XY.(因此，RI prime 就是 RI 加上一个固定位移。这个固定位移就是这两个坐标轴之间的位移。坐标轴从这里移动到这里。如果这是……如果这是……这是 R。这是原始坐标轴 XY。这是 X prime，Y prime。所以，这个位移……很明显……让我看看。RRI prime 是倒置的。这是……抱歉。这是原始坐标轴。这是……固定点在这里。这是 R。这是 R prime。很明显，R prime 等于 R 加 D。所以，这是 XY。)

I made a mistake. This is XY. This is X prime, Y prime. This is the displacement. This is R. This is R prime. It is obvious that R prime is R plus D. This D has nothing to do with R. This D is the displacement of the coordinate origin. So, it has nothing to do with the number of parts. It has nothing to do with the number of parts. So, what is the rest of the formula? It is... By definition, it is equal to... So, it is equal to... plus D. This is obvious that... plus... This D is independent of I. So, it is equal to summation of M, I, D. So... So, R prime is the center of mass.(我犯了一个错误。这是XY。这是X'，Y'。这是位移。这是R。这是R'。显然，R'等于R加D。这个D与R无关。这个D是坐标原点的位移。因此，它与零件数量无关。它与零件数量无关。那么，公式的其余部分是什么？根据定义，它等于...所以，它等于...加D。显然...加...这个D与I无关。因此，它等于M、I、D的和。所以...所以，R'是质心。)

所以有：$$\left( \sum m_{i} \right)\vec{r_{i}} ^\prime=\sum m_{i}\vec{r_{i}}'=\sum m_{i}(\vec{r_{i}}+\vec{d})=\sum m_{i}r_{i}+\left( \sum m_{i} \right)\vec{d}$$
那么在 $r'$ 坐标系下的质心：$$\vec{r}_{\text{com}}'=\frac{\sum m_{i}\vec{r_{i}}'}{\sum m_{i}}=\frac{\sum m_{i}\vec{r_{i}}}{\sum m_{i}}+\vec{d}=\vec{r}_{\text{com}}+\vec{d}$$
By definition, it is summation of M. It is equal to summation of M, I, R, I prime. This is the new center of mass, D. D... So, it is equal to summation of M, I, R, I. It is summation of M. Plus... So, it is equal to R, center of mass, plus D. So, in other words, the new center of mass, the coordinate, is equal to the original center of mass, plus D. So, this is the same as the picture. So, this represents the center of mass.(根据定义，它是M的总和。它等于M、I、R、I'的总和。这是新的质心D。D...所以，它等于M、I、R、I的总和。它是M的总和。加上...所以，它等于R（质心）加上D。*换句话说，新的质心坐标等于原来的质心坐标加上 D*。这与图示一致。因此，这代表质心。)

The two definitions are in the same place. This is the first part of the formula. The first part is... I don't move. I don't move the origin, but rotate it. Rotate the coordinate x, to see if the definition is still the same. This is a bit complicated to write, but it is actually very simple to explain.(两个定义在同一个位置。这是公式的第一部分。第一部分是……我不移动。我不移动原点，而是旋转它。旋转坐标x，看看定义是否仍然相同。写起来有点复杂，但实际上解释起来非常简单。)

Why? Because this definition of center of mass, the rotation of the coordinate, I call it R, I prime. The rotation of the coordinate is a linear transformation The original R, I, each R has x, y, z. Later, x prime, y prime, z prime is a linear combination of x, y, z. If you don't believe this, imagine there are two dimensions, one x, one y. If you rotate it, x prime, y prime, is a linear combination of the original one. And this linear combination doesn't depend on which I you are.（为什么？因为这个质心的定义，坐标系的旋转，我称之为R，I'。坐标系的旋转是一个线性变换。原来的R，I，每个R都有x、y、z。之后的x'、y'、z'是x、y、z的线性组合。如果你不相信这一点，想象一下有两个维度，一个x，一个y。如果你旋转它，x'、y'就是原始坐标的线性组合。而且这个线性组合不依赖于你选择的是哪个I。）

Every point, from R to R prime, this linear combination is the same. If you take this formula, all the R, I, R prime on the right, R1, R2, R3, all use the same linear combination to add up these three. So the left side is also the same linear combination. Did you understand what I said just now? You can write it in algebraic form, but the meaning is what I said just now. In other words, a rotation of coordinate system is a linear combination of the original coordinate system. And the coefficient of this linear combination has nine coefficients in total.（从R到R'的每一个点，这种线性组合都是相同的。如果你采用这个公式，右边的所有R、I、R'，即R1、R2、R3，都是用相同的线性组合将这三者相加。因此，左边也是同样的线性组合。你明白我刚才说的意思了吗？你可以用代数形式写出来，但含义就是我刚才所说的。换句话说，坐标系的旋转就是原坐标系的一个线性组合。而这个线性组合的系数总共有九个。）

Why nine? Because x1 is a linear combination of x, y, z. So there are three coefficients. y prime is also three terms. z prime is also three terms. So it's three times three. This is called a matrix. So this transformation is a matrix multiplied by the original x, y, z. And the important point is that the nine numbers in this matrix, the nine coefficients, have nothing to do with which particle.（为什么是九？因为x1是x、y、z的线性组合，所以有三个系数。y'也是三项，z'也是三项，所以是三乘三。这就叫矩阵。因此这个变换就是矩阵乘以原来的x、y、z。关键在于这个矩阵中的九个数、九个系数，与具体是哪个粒子无关。）

这里的意思是说，坐标轴旋转以后，原来在 $r$ 系下有分量 $x,y,z$，而在 $r'$ 系下的每个分量，都是 $x,y,z$ 分量的线性组合，而且这种变化对 $x',y'z'$ 都是一样的，所以会有 $3 \times 3=9$ 个变换系数。

They are all one transformation. So a rotation is represented algebraically by a 3x3 matrix. Do you know that this matrix has a special name? This matrix is called an orthogonal matrix. Why is it called an orthogonal matrix? The meaning of orthogonal matrix is that originally it was an orthogonal coordinate system. After using the nine coefficients, the result is still an orthogonal system. So this is called an orthogonal matrix.（它们都是同一种变换。因此，旋转可以用一个3x3矩阵代数表示。你知道这个矩阵有个特殊的名字吗？这个矩阵被称为正交矩阵。为什么叫正交矩阵呢？正交矩阵的含义是：原本它是一个正交坐标系，经过这九个系数的变换后，结果仍然是一个正交系统。所以它被称为正交矩阵。）

It doesn't mean that you can write nine as you like. You can write nine as you like. You can try it. You can do 2x2. After two dimensions... Let's take two dimensions. Two dimensions are x and y. Then x prime is equal to cosine theta. It becomes like this when you rotate it. Let's say this is a theta. It becomes cosine theta x plus sine theta y. y prime is equal to minus sine theta x plus cosine theta y. Think about it carefully.（这并不意味着你可以随意书写数字9。你可以随心所欲地写9，不妨试试看。你可以计算2乘2。在二维空间中...我们以二维为例。二维坐标是x和y。那么x'等于cosθ。旋转后就变成这样。假设这个角度是θ，就变成了cosθ乘以x加上sinθ乘以y。y'等于负sinθ乘以x加上cosθ乘以y。仔细想想看。）

实际上在二维旋转中，我们有 (参考费曼讲义第 11.3 章节)：
$$\begin{equation}\begin{alignedat}{4} &x'&&=x&&\cos\theta+y&&\sin\theta,\\&y'&&=-x&&\sin\theta+y&&\cos\theta,\\&z'&&=z\end{alignedat}\end{equation}$$
这里的的这个矩阵（也叫旋转矩阵）就是 $$R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos \theta & \sin \theta \\ 
-\sin \theta & \cos \theta 
\end{bmatrix}$$
Look at this cosine theta and sine theta. These four numbers are a 2x2 matrix. This matrix is called orthogonal. These three dimensions are 3x3. n dimensions are nxn. But look at these four numbers. They are related to each other. They can't be moved around. The same nine numbers can't be moved around.（看看这个cosθ和sinθ。这四个数构成一个2x2矩阵。这个矩阵被称为正交矩阵。这三个维度是3x3矩阵。n个维度就是nxn矩阵。但看看这四个数，它们是相互关联的。它们不能随意调换位置。同样的，这九个数也不能随意调换位置。）

Mathematically, they form an orthogonal matrix. Anyway, what's important to us now is... Let me show you what I just showed you. You combine the three components of R, I, X, Y, and Z with a 3x3 matrix. It becomes R, I, prime. The left side becomes the same combination. They are all linear. This proves the statement I just made. The R center of mass, as so defined, is independent of the choice of coordinate system. We just proved that it is independent of the rotation of the coordinate system.（从数学上讲，它们构成了一个正交矩阵。不过现在对我们重要的是……让我再演示一遍刚才的内容。你把R、I、X、Y、Z这三个分量与一个3x3矩阵组合起来，就得到了R、I撇。左边也会变成相同的组合形式。这些都是线性的。这证明了我刚才的论断——*如此定义的R质心，与坐标系的选择无关。我们刚刚证明了它与坐标系的旋转无关。*）

Since the translation and rotation are independent, you can always rotate and displace from one coordinate system to another. That's why it's called QED. Second, rotation. All linear. The key word is all linear. That's why it's called QED. Is there a problem with what I just said? There are two problems. The first one is that you need to prove it. That's the most important thing. You don't usually talk about it. You need to prove it. The second one is whether you can prove it.(由于平移和旋转是独立的，你总是可以通过旋转和位移从一个坐标系转换到另一个坐标系。这就是为什么它被称为QED。其次，旋转。都是线性的。关键词是"都是线性的"。这就是为什么它被称为QED。我刚才说的有什么问题吗？有两个问题。第一个是你需要证明它。这是最重要的事情。你通常不会谈论这个。你需要证明它。第二个是你能不能证明它。)

> [!NOTE]
> QED 是拉丁短语 "Quod Erat Demonstrandum" 的缩写，意思是“这正是所要证明的”。在数学和逻辑中，它通常用于标记证明的结束，表明已经成功地证明了之前提出的命题或定理。

It's very simple. After you think about it, you need to prove that rotation and translation are independent. These are all very simple things. OK, so that's our first problem. Now I'm going to talk about the second problem. Consider two groups of particles. The first group of particles is called mi. Its coordinate is ri. The second group of particles is called mj. Its position is sj. For example, there are three particles in the first group. Then there are four particles in the second group.(这很简单。仔细想想，你需要证明旋转和平移是相互独立的。这些都是非常基础的概念。好了，这就是我们的第一个定理。现在我要讨论第二个定理。考虑两组粒子。第一组粒子称为mi，其坐标为ri。第二组粒子称为mj，其位置为sj。举例来说，第一组有三个粒子，第二组则有四个粒子。)

第一组三个粒子，质量为 $M_{i}$，位置为 $\vec{r}_{i}$；第二组四个粒子，质量为 $M_{j}$，位置为 $\vec{s}_{j}$,

The first group of particles has a center of mass. For example, here. The second group of particles also has a center of mass. Here. The circle represents the center of mass. So there are two groups. Each group has its own center of mass theorem. Consider two groups of particles. The center of mass of the total system is exactly the center of mass of two particles.(第一组粒子有一个质心。例如，这里。第二组粒子也有一个质心。这里。圆圈代表质心。所以有两组。每组都有自己的质心定理。考虑两组粒子。*整个系统的质心正好是两组质心的质心*。)

One with mass sum of ri. This is the total mass of the first group. At the center of mass of these particles. The other with mass sum of mj. This is another group. At the center of mass of these particles. At the center of mass of these particles. Imagine that all these masses are concentrated at that point. And then for the second group, you concentrate all those second groups of masses at the center of mass of the second group.(一组质量为ri的总和。这是第一组的总质量。位于这些粒子的质心处。另一组质量为 mj 的总和。这是另一组。位于这些粒子的质心处。想象所有这些质量都集中在该点上。然后对于第二组，你将所有第二组的质量集中在第二组的质心处。)

This theorem says the center of mass of the total system is exactly the center of mass of two particles. One with mass sum of ri. Proof. The R of the total center of mass. We write it like this. By definition, it is equal to the sum of ri, plus the sum of mj, plus the sum of mi, plus the sum of mj.（该定理表明，整个系统的质心恰好就是两个粒子的质心。其中一个粒子的质量为ri的总和。证明如下：整个系统质心的R值。我们这样表示。根据定义，它等于ri的总和加上mj的总和，再加上mi的总和，最后加上mj的总和。）

$$\begin{align}
\vec{R}_{\text{com}}&=\frac{\sum M_{i} \vec{r}_{i} + \sum M_{j} \vec{s}_{j}}{\left( \sum M_{i} \right) + \left( \sum M_{j} \right)} \\[1.2ex]
&=\frac{\frac{\sum M_{i}\vec{r}_{i}}{\sum M_{i}} \cdot \left( \sum M_{i} \right)+\frac{\sum M_{j}\vec{s}_{j}}{\sum M_{j}} \cdot \left( \sum M_{j} \right)}{\left( \sum M_{i} \right) + \left( \sum M_{j} \right)}
\end{align}$$
公式第一行就是质心最原始的定义，所有粒子的质量与位置乘积的总和除以总质量。
公式第二个行，分子部分，第一项代表第一组粒子的质心与第一组粒子总质量的乘积，第二项代表第二组粒子的质心与第二组粒子总质量的乘积，而分母可以理解为两个质心的总质量。

That's the original definition. But this is equal to the sum of mi, ri, divided by the sum of m. This is the center of mass of the first group of particles. Multiply this by the sum of m. When you do it, plus the sum of mj, sj, divided by the sum of mi, plus the sum of mi, divided by the sum of m, plus the sum of mi.(这是最初的定义。但这等于mi和ri的总和除以m的总和。这是第一组粒子的质心。将其乘以m的总和。当你这样做时，再加上mj和sj的总和除以mi的总和，再加上mi的总和除以m的总和，再加上mi的总和。)

To do algebraic logarithm, because this cancel. But what is this? This is total mass at one point times the center of mass of the first group. This is the total mass of the second group times the center of mass of the second group. Multiply these two to get the total mass. This is what we learned later. So QED.(要做代数对数，因为这样可以消去。但这是什么？这是某一点的总质量乘以第一组的质心。这是第二组的总质量乘以第二组的质心。将这两者相乘得到总质量。这是我们后来学到的。因此，证毕。)

Everybody happy? Okay. Now we are going to discuss Newton's equation. Newton's equation was applied to many particles.

Similar angle particles. So mi, ri, double dot. So there is a total external force on the i-th particle.

We write that as this. If there are five forces acting on point i, we make the vector sum of these five forces and write that as uf. Jiao Tang, internal forces.

Internal forces is summation of f. This notation tells you the force on particle i exerted by particle j. The definition is what I just told you. Okay. Now I am going to sum this.

Sum over i. First you get the... Secondly, you get the sum of this. So it is the sum of i not equal to j of f, i, j. But by Newton's third law, we know f, i, j is equal to minus f, j, i. The force suffered by particle i exerted by particle j is equal and opposite to the force exerted on particle j by particle i. So in here, we always have two terms. f, i, i, j and f, j, i, i. And the sum of the two is zero.

So therefore, this term is zero. So we have a grand theorem. Summation m, i, r, i, double dot is equal to sum of... There is a total external force.

So if we have a group of particles, if you take the total force on it, you get this very simple equation. It is a trivial statement, actually. Now, m, i, r, i, definition.

m, i, r, i, dot. Mass times velocity is called momentum. The book always calls it linear momentum.

Actually, in usual practice, when just a course is momentum, the book calls it linear momentum because later on we are going to study angular momentum. But first, let's stick to linear momentum. In any case, in usual physics language, momentum is equal to linear momentum.

The concept that there is a linear momentum was due to Galileo. And it was Galileo who realized that if a particle does not suffer any external forces, its momentum, its linear momentum, its momentum remains constant. The reason that that was such a difficult thing to realize is because there is usually friction.

And so it was thought that if something is not acted on, it would still slow down. Galileo recognized that that is due to some external thing. So if you have a very heavy body, if the influence of friction on it is very little, then its momentum is constant if it's not acted on by another force.

So this is called momentum, and it's usually called P-I. And the determinant is said by George Bentham, sum of P-I, UDT, W total external force. If a system is not acted by external force, then the momentum is conserved.

If a system is isolated, is not acted on by, it has all kinds of internal forces, but not acted on by any external force, then, according to what we just said, its momentum's derivative is zero, so its momentum is conserved. So the conservation of momentum is the most important theorem in physics. Any questions? The mathematics seems to be extremely simple, but when you apply it to cases, it has very deep consequences.

So in particular, let us now discuss what is discussed in the book. It's called the rocket movement. When a rocket moves, it keeps on throwing particles backwards.

Because of momentum conservation, if a rocket with fuel is moving, if it throws some of its fuel backwards, it will be accelerated, and that's what we are going to discuss. And the only physics principle involved is conservation of momentum.
