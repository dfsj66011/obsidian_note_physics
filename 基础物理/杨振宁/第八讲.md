### 题外话：研究方向的选择

In physics, there are three Americans. Their work is called high-energy physics or basic particle physics. Their work is, of course, very important, so it is worth getting. I have already told you that basic particle physics has had significant development in the past 50 years.（在物理学领域，有三位美国科学家。他们的研究被称为高能物理或基本粒子物理。当然，他们的工作非常重要，因此值得深入了解。我已经告诉过你们，在过去 50 年里，基本粒子物理取得了重大进展。）

But it is very unlikely that similar important developments will happen in the next 20, 30 or 40 years. As I told you repeatedly, the most likely developments fluctuate very rapidly in physics. So for your generation, if you go into high-energy physics or elementary particle physics, the possibility of you making a very important contribution is not very large.（但在未来 20、30 或 40 年内，类似的重要突破不太可能再次发生。正如我反复强调的那样，物理学领域最可能的研究进展往往变化极快。因此对你们这代人而言，如果选择高能物理或基本粒子物理方向，要做出重大贡献的可能性并不大。）

It's different periods. The prospects are different. When I was a graduate student, the prospects were good because that field was young, was the beginning. Now that field is old and it has many difficulties. So the experiments that are important in experimental high-energy physics cost billions of dollars. As a consequence, there are very few experiments.（时代不同，前景各异。我读研究生时，前景很好，因为那个领域刚刚起步，充满朝气。如今那个领域已经成熟，面临诸多困难。实验高能物理学中那些重要的实验动辄耗资数十亿美元。因此，能开展的实验少之又少。）

But in contrast, two weeks ago, a very exciting new experiment was done by a professor named Moses Chan. He grew up in Hong Kong. He got his Ph.D. in Cornell. His field is low-temperature physics. In particular, he specialized in helium. Helium at low temperatures of approximately 2 degrees Kelvin becomes a superfluid. And that has been known since the 1930s. It's a beautiful subject. What he found now is that if you go to lower temperature and go to about 60 atmospheres pressure, it becomes a solid.（但相比之下，两周前，一位名叫 Moses Chan(中文译名，陈鸿渭）的教授进行了一项非常激动人心的新实验。他在香港长大，在康奈尔大学获得博士学位，研究领域是低温物理学。他尤其专注于氦的研究。氦在约 2 开尔文的低温下会变成超流体，这一现象自 20 世纪 30 年代就已为人所知，是个非常美妙的课题。而他最新的发现是，如果将温度进一步降低并施加约 60 个大气压的压力，氦就会变成固体。）

That was also known before, namely that under pressure in low temperatures, liquid helium becomes a crystal. That has been known for a long time. What he found that's new is that that solid also has a superfluid component in it. And that was not known before. So he published this paper. And I'm sure he will be nominated for a Nobel Prize very soon. We have invited him to come to Tsinghua to give a lecture. And he will give three lectures next June. So at that time, perhaps you could listen to the lecture.（此前已知的是，液态氦在低温高压下会结晶，这一现象早已为人所知。而他的新发现在于，这种固态晶体内部还存在超流体成分——这是前所未闻的。因此他发表了这篇论文。我相信他很快就会被提名诺贝尔奖（没得）。我们已邀请他来清华讲学，明年六月他将进行三场讲座，届时你们或许可以来聆听。）

I hope I can convince him to come to become a faculty member of Tsinghua. His experiment does not require a whole institute. His experiment can be done maybe with one person and one graduate student. So that's the kind of experiment which China should try to concentrate on because it's easier to have great success. （我希望我能说服他来清华任教。他的实验不需要整个研究所，可能只需要一个人和一个研究生就能完成。这正是中国应该集中精力尝试的实验类型，因为更容易取得巨大成功。）

### 简谐运动

Okay, now we'll go to what we discussed last time. We were talking about the harmonic motion. If we have a spring, the block would oscillate. And the equation is mx double dot minus kx. We often times write it this way. X double dot equal to minus omega squared x omega squared is equal to K over F. And the solution of this is a cosine x. If you take the cosine omega x and differentiate it twice, you get omega squared with a minus sign. But the sine omega x is also a solution because the equation is linear. So a sum of the two is also a solution.（好了，现在我们来回顾上次讨论的内容。我们当时在讲简谐运动。如果我们有一个弹簧，物块就会振荡。方程为mx双点减kx。我们通常这样写：X双点等于负ω平方x，其中ω平方等于K除以F。这个方程的解是一个余弦函数x。如果你对cos(ωx)进行两次微分，会得到带负号的ω平方。但sin(ωx)也是解，因为方程是线性的。所以两者的和也是解。）

$$m \ddot{x}=-kx$$
通常写为：$\ddot{x}=-\omega^2x$，其中 $\omega^2=\frac{k}{m}$，方程的解为：$$x=A \cos(\omega t)$$
$\cos(\omega t)$ 微分两次会产生 $-\omega^2$，同样 $B\sin(\omega t)$也是它的解，因为方程是线性的，所以其更一般的通解为 $$x=A\cos(\omega t)+B\sin(\omega t)=C \cos(\omega t+\delta)=D \sin(\omega t+\Delta)$$
 But you can also write this as c times cosine because cosine of a sum is equal to a cosine plus a sine. And of course, these are all equivalent forms and you can write as d sine. Such a motion is called harmonic. An important thing is that small oscillations are all approximately harmonic. Wait a minute. Because the force is not minus kx, we can try to expand the policies.（但你也可以将其写成c乘以余弦的形式，因为和的余弦等于余弦加正弦。当然，这些都是等价的形式，你也可以写成d乘以正弦。这种运动被称为简谐运动。*重要的是，小幅度的振动都近似于简谐运动*。等一下。如果力不是 -kx，我们可以尝试展开这些策略。）

如果力不是 $-kx$，比如存在一些二次项、三次项等，当 $x$ 非常小时，二次项和三次项将远小于线性项。因此，它近似于谐波。

So, for example, plus half of x squared plus beta x cubed plus etc. The force may have a linear term and then we have a quadratic term and a cubic term. But if the oscillation is very small, the quadratic and cubic terms, if x is very small, the quadratic and the cubic terms are going to be much smaller than the linear term. So therefore, it becomes approximately harmonic. That means only this term is important. So all small oscillations are approximately harmonic.（例如，加上x平方的一半，再加上βx的三次方，依此类推。力可能包含一个线性项，然后我们有一个二次项和一个三次项。但如果振荡非常小，当x非常小时，二次项和三次项将远小于线性项。因此，它近似于谐波。这意味着只有这一项是重要的。*所以所有的小振荡都近似于谐波*。）

So that's why harmonic motion is extremely important. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, you know, quantum mechanics was developed. How was it developed? First, people knew that there was some problem with classical mechanics. I already mentioned that people did not understand why an electron going around the nucleus would not continually radiate. And if it does radiate, it will lose energy. And therefore, it will go spiral into the nucleus and then combine with the nucleus.（这就是为什么谐波运动如此重要。实际上，20 世纪初，量子力学开始发展。它是如何发展的呢？首先，人们意识到经典力学存在一些问题。我之前提到过，人们无法理解为什么绕原子核运动的电子不会持续辐射能量。如果它确实辐射能量，就会损失能量。因此，它会螺旋式地坠入原子核，然后与原子核结合。）

That means the atom would not be stable. So in the first 20 years of the 20th century, people knew that there was a problem. And gradually, people learned that the mechanics has to be changed. And so the main problem at that time, one of the main problems, perhaps the most important main problem, was to find a new mechanics. And that was where Heisenberg, as a young man, made a breakthrough. He later wrote that he had hay fever.（这意味着原子将不稳定。因此，在 20 世纪的前 20 年里，人们已经意识到存在问题。渐渐地，人们认识到必须改变力学体系。当时的主要问题之一，或许是最重要的核心问题，就是寻找新的力学理论。正是在这个领域，年轻的海森堡取得了突破性进展。他后来写道，当时自己正患着花粉症。）

He was very sensitive. So he took a vacation in a small island in northern Germany. And there he began to work on the dynamics, a new dynamics of the harmonic oscillator, this one that we are talking about. And there he found the clue to a new dynamics. And that later became quantum mechanics. However, he did not know enough mathematics.（他非常敏感。于是，他去了德国北部的一个小岛度假。在那里，他开始研究动力学，即我们正在讨论的谐振子的新动力学。在那里，他找到了新动力学的线索。后来，这发展成了量子力学。然而，他的数学知识还不够。）

So he wrote a paper about the harmonic motion using the new dynamics. That paper is now called the One Man Paper. It was published under his name. He left that paper with his, he was a postdoc. So he had an advisor. The advisor was Max Born, who was 15 years older than Heisenberg.（于是他写了一篇关于谐波运动的论文，运用了新的动力学理论。这篇论文如今被称为“One Man Paper”，以他的名义发表。当时他还是博士后，便将论文交给了他的导师马克斯·玻恩——这位比海森堡年长 15 岁的学者。）

So Max Born took a look at it and recognized that there was something very important. Namely, the mathematics that Heisenberg was talking about was matrix mathematics. But Heisenberg didn't know matrices. So Heisenberg had very complicated equations, which Born recognized as matrices. So Born, in Heisenberg's absence, Heisenberg went away to do something. And Born collaborated with another postdoc of his named Jordan.（于是马克斯·玻恩研究了它，并意识到其中有些非常重要的东西。也就是说，海森堡所讨论的数学是矩阵数学。但海森堡并不懂矩阵。所以海森堡的方程非常复杂，而玻恩认出这些就是矩阵。在海森堡离开去做其他事情的时候，玻恩与他另一位名叫 Jordan 的博士后合作。）

And they wrote a paper. That was called the Two Man Paper now. And then when Heisenberg came back, the three of them wrote a Three Man Paper. And that One Man Paper, Two Man Paper, Three Man Paper founded quantum mechanics. So we see how the harmonic oscillator played a very important role in the history of physics. （他们写了一篇论文，现在被称为 “Two Man Paper”。后来海森堡回来后，他们三人又合写了一篇 “Three Man Paper”。正是这些“一人论文”、“二人论文”和“三人论文”奠定了量子力学的基础。由此可见，谐振子在物理学史上扮演了极其重要的角色。）

Now, what we just said is that any motion in some respects, if the oscillation is very small, is approximately harmonic. But that is under the condition that this is a positive sign. What happens if it's negative? This is a negative sign. What happens if it's positive? One can construct such a mechanical system, too. Does anybody know how to solve that equation? What, after second derivatives, comes back to itself? What do you need is a quantity x as a function. Sorry, this should be t. It's harmonic with respect to time. What, x as a function of t. The trick here is, you want to find an x, in this case.（我们刚才说到，任何运动在某种程度上，只要振动幅度很小，都可以近似看作简谐运动。 但这必须是在这是一个负号。如果是正信号呢？我们也可以构建这样的机械系统。有人知道如何解这个方程吗？什么在二阶导数后会回到自身？你需要的是一个关于时间的函数x。抱歉，这里应该是t。它是随时间谐波变化的。即 x 作为 t 的函数。这里的技巧在于，你需要在这种情况下找到一个 x。）

这里的关键是，有个负号，$\cos$ 或 $\sin$ 两次求导可以得到一个负号的自己，问题是如果改为正的呢？$$m \ddot{x}=kx$$什么玩意儿两次求导后还是自己的形式？$$x=e^{\omega t}$$
You want to find an x whose second derivative goes back to the original form with a coefficient. And we know it's a sine or a cosine. Because a sine, after you differentiate, becomes minus cosine. That becomes cosine. Cosine, you differentiate, becomes minus sine. So therefore, after two differentiations, it comes back to itself with a minus sign.（你想找到一个x，其二阶导数能回到原函数形式并带有一个系数。我们知道它要么是正弦函数，要么是余弦函数。因为正弦函数求导后变成负的余弦函数，再求导一次又变回余弦函数。而余弦函数求导后变成负的正弦函数。因此，经过两次求导后，它会以负号的形式回到自身。）

Now we want something which comes back to itself without a minus sign. Does anybody know what that function is? Maybe you have not learned enough calculus. In fact, this case is simpler. It's the exponential function. If x is equal to exponential omega t, if I differentiate it, the exponential function after differentiation remains the same form. After you do it again, it remains again the same form.（现在我们想要的是一个不改变符号的自我回归函数。有人知道这是什么函数吗？也许你们微积分还没学到这个程度。实际上，这个例子更简单。它是指数函数。如果x等于e的ωt次方，当我求导时，指数函数在微分后仍保持原形式。再次求导后，依然保持相同形式。）

So if I take this, then x double dot is equal to omega squared, x plus omega t. So you see, therefore, if you again define k over m as omega squared, then this is a solution. But the exponential minus omega t is also a solution. Because each time you differentiate, you get a minus omega.（所以如果我这样处理，那么x的双点就等于ω的平方乘以x加上ω乘以t。你看，因此，如果你再次定义k除以m等于ω的平方，那么这就是一个解。但e的负ωt次方也是一个解。因为每次求导时，你都会得到一个负ω。）

所以此时，$$\ddot{x}=\omega^2e^{\omega t}$$
And the square of minus omega is omega squared. So another solution is a negative exponential. So therefore, the general solution is x is equal to a exponential omega t plus b exponential minus omega t. Each of them, after you differentiate twice, will give you omega squared times the original one.（负欧米伽的平方就是欧米伽的平方。所以另一个解是一个负指数函数。因此，通解为x等于a乘以e的欧米伽t次方加上b乘以e的负欧米伽t次方。其中每一项在二次微分后都会得到欧米伽平方乘以原函数的结果。）

实际上，$x=e^{-\omega t}$ 也是它的解，因此通解形式为：$$x=Ae^{\omega t}+Be^{-\omega t}$$这是双曲余弦函数，可以合并为：$$x=C\cosh(\omega t+\delta)=D\sinh(\omega +\Delta)$$
Because it's linear, so therefore you can linearly combine. Now, does anybody know what is the exponential omega t plus exponential minus omega t? That's called the hyperbolic cosine. So this can be written as c hyperbolic cosine of omega t plus delta.（因为它是线性的，所以你可以线性组合。现在，有人知道e^(ωt)加上e^(-ωt)是什么吗？这叫双曲余弦函数。所以这个可以写成c乘以双曲余弦函数(ωt + δ)。）

You can also write it as a d hyperbolic sine omega t plus delta. Exactly like that. The only thing is you change sine and cosine into hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. It's very convenient to familiarize yourself with the hyperbolic functions. Does anybody know why harmonic functions sine and cosine are so related to hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine? Why? （你也可以把它写成d乘以双曲正弦函数（ωt + δ）。就是这样。唯一的不同在于你将正弦和余弦替换为双曲正弦和双曲余弦。熟悉双曲函数会非常方便。有人知道*为什么简谐函数正弦和余弦与双曲正弦和双曲余弦如此相关吗？为什么呢？*）

$$\cos x=\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}\quad \quad\sin x=\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}\quad\quad \cosh=\frac{e^x+e^{x}}{2}\quad \quad \sinh=\frac{e^x-e^{x}}{2}$$

（证明与解释见本文末尾）


That is because cosine x, in fact, is equal to one half of exponential i x plus exponential minus i x. And sine of x is equal to is equal to i exponential i x minus x minus i x. So you see that the cosine and you compare that with. Why? Cosh.  Cosh of x is equal to exponential. So you see that these two are very similar, except that there is an i in front of the x for the hyperbolic, for the ordinary harmonic functions. There's also a similar formula here.（这是因为余弦x实际上等于e的ix次方加上e的负ix次方的一半。而正弦x等于i乘以e的ix次方减去e的负ix次方。所以你看余弦函数和双曲余弦函数的对比。为什么？双曲余弦函数等于e的x次方加上e的负x次方的一半。你会发现这两个公式非常相似，只是在普通三角函数中的x前面有个i。这里也有一个类似的公式。）

## 第八章：势能和能量守恒

### 能量守恒

Okay, now we go back to chapter eight. We have talked about the potential energy. We'll talk about two kinds of potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is equal to m g z. Z is upwards. We have talked about the spin potential energy. And that's equal to one half k x squared.（好的，现在我们回到第八章。我们已经讨论了势能。我们将讨论两种势能。重力势能等于mgz，z是向上的。我们还讨论了弹性势能，它等于1/2kx²。）

重力势能：$mgz$；弹性势能：$\frac{1}{2}kx^2$

These are called conservative, conservative systems. In other words, the kinetic energy and the potential energy added is a constant. In the case of the spoon, in the case of this spoon, when this spoon is most compressed, the potential energy is high. The kinetic energy is zero. When it's most compressed, the block is not moving. So V is equal to zero.（这些被称为*保守系统。换句话说，动能和势能相加是一个常数*。以这个弹簧为例，当弹簧被压缩到最大限度时，势能很高，动能为零。因为当它被压缩到极限时，物体是不动的，所以速度V等于零。）

So the kinetic energy is equal to zero. So it's the minimum kinetic energy, maximum potential energy. When it goes to this other end, it again becomes minimum kinetic energy, maximum potential energy. In the middle, the potential energy is zero, because x is equal to zero. And the velocity is the highest, so the kinetic energy is highest. So therefore, it oscillates between the kinetic and potential energy.（因此，动能等于零。所以这是最小动能、最大势能的状态。当它到达另一端时，又会变成最小动能、最大势能的状态。在中间位置，势能为零，因为x等于零。而速度达到最大值，所以动能也最大。因此，系统在动能和势能之间来回振荡。）

But the sum of the two is a constant. That's why it's called a conservative system. And in a conservative system, if I plot the potential energy as a function of x, like one half of k x squared is a parabola. And if the total energy is here, it oscillates between these two points. This is minimum kinetic energy, maximum potential energy. And at this point, the kinetic energy is zero.（但两者之和是一个常数。*这就是为什么它被称为保守系统*。在保守系统中，如果我将势能作为 x 的函数绘制出来，比如 1/2kx² 是一条抛物线。如果总能量在这里，它就会在这两点之间振荡。这是最小动能，最大势能。而在这一点，动能为零。）

The kinetic energy is always equal to this. So at these two points, the kinetic energy is zero. And at this point, the kinetic energy is the maximum. For a non-conservative system, for example, if this block is moving on a rough surface so that there is friction, if this block is moving back and forth, but on a table with friction, then it will continue to lose energy. So the path would be something like this. This is the potential energy.（动能始终等于这个值。因此在这两点，动能为零。而在这一点，动能达到最大值。对于一个*非保守系统*，例如，如果这个滑块在粗糙表面上移动，存在摩擦力，如果这个滑块来回运动，但在有摩擦的桌面上，那么它会不断损失能量。因此路径会是这样。这是势能。）

Its total energy would continuously be smaller, so it will go... What I'm plotting is the sum of the kinetic plus potential energy. And eventually it comes to stop here. What happens to the energy? We'll come to this later. It becomes heat. The friction generates the heat, and so the energy, the mechanical energy, is lost. But the total energy is not lost.（它的总能量会不断减少，所以它会继续运动……我绘制的是动能加势能的总和。最终它会在这里停下来。能量去哪儿了？我们稍后会讨论这个问题。它转化成了热能。摩擦力产生了热量，因此机械能损失了。但总能量并没有损失。）

The mechanical energy's loss becomes the thermal energy. It becomes heat energy. That is the fundamental law of thermodynamics, which we'll come back later to. So in a case like this, it's a non-conservative system. Conservative and non-conservative refer only to the mechanical part. The whole system, we know, is always conserved.（机械能的损失转化为热能。它变成了热能。这是热力学的基本定律，我们稍后会再讨论。因此，在这种情况下，这是一个非保守系统。*保守和非保守仅指机械部分。我们知道，整个系统总是守恒的。*）

The conservation of energy is universally true. But of course you know that the total energy is conserved. That in a non-conservative system, the mechanical energy loss goes into heat. And if you add the heat energy to the mechanical energy, you get a constant. That was only understood in the middle of the 19th century. After that, it became an important fundamental law of physics.（能量守恒定律是普遍成立的。当然，你知道总能量是守恒的。在一个非保守系统中，机械能的损失会转化为热能。如果把热能加到机械能上，总和是不变的。这一点直到 19 世纪中叶才被理解。此后，它成为物理学的一条重要基本定律。）

But at the beginning of the 20th century, as I told you, there were puzzles about why an electron does not continually spiral into the nucleus. And then there were other problems, like radioactivity. So in the 1930s, Niels Bohr, who was one of the great physicists of the 20th century, advocated that in fact energy conservation is not universally true.（但正如我之前所说，20 世纪初存在一些谜团，比如为什么电子不会持续螺旋进入原子核。此外还有其他问题，比如放射性。因此，在 20 世纪 30 年代，20 世纪最伟大的物理学家之一尼尔斯·玻尔提出，能量守恒实际上并非普遍适用。）

That turned out to be a wrong suggestion. But I told you this only to show that at each moment, if there is a problem, one will have to find a way out. And one of the ways that one would look into is to see whether some fundamental laws of physics was defective.And that's why Niels Bohr proposed in the 1930s that energy is not absolutely conserved. （结果证明这是个错误的建议。但*我告诉你这些，只是想说明在每一个时刻，如果出现问题，人们都必须找到解决办法。而人们会考虑的方法之一，就是看看物理学的一些基本定律是否存在缺陷*。这就是为什么尼尔斯·玻尔在 20 世纪 30 年代提出能量并非绝对守恒的原因。）

Now suppose at this level, I have a slide. Suppose this height is h. Then the potential energy difference between here and here, when it goes from this point to this, it loses potential energy. The lost potential energy is equal to mgh. What happens if the slide looks different? If a child slides down this smooth slide, the potential energy difference is still the same thing. It's mgz.（现在假设在这个高度上有一个滑梯，假设这个高度是 h。那么从这里到这里的过程中，当它从这个点滑到那个点时，就会失去势能。失去的势能等于 mgh。如果滑梯的形状不同会发生什么？如果一个孩子从光滑的滑梯上滑下来，势能差仍然是相同的。它就是 mgz。）

So in this case, it's mgh. In other words, the total potential energy difference is independent of the path. Whether it's this way or this way, the potential energy difference between the beginning and the end is the same. It's called path independence of potential energy. Anybody with any questions? （所以在这种情况下，它是mgh。换句话说，*总势能差与路径无关*。无论是这条路径还是那条路径，起点和终点之间的势能差都是相同的。这被称为势能的路径无关性。有人有什么问题吗？）

### 势能曲线

Okay, now let us look at the potential energy curve. This is u of x. This is x. And the force is minus du dx.（好的，现在让我们来看看 *势能曲线*。这是u(x)。这是x。而力等于负的du/dx。）

![[80.png|200]]

$$F=-\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}x}=m\ddot{x}$$
这个图怎么看？图中横线代表总能量，则

* 最左侧与横线相交一点显然势能等于总能量，即开始点动能为 0，因为此时还没开始动，这一点斜率是负的，则力是正的；所以接下来往正向运动；
* 到达图中短竖线与曲线交点后，势差高度（图中垂线）就是动能的大小，显然动能越来越大，而斜率逐渐减小，在低谷处斜率为 0，意味着力逐渐减小，直至为 0；
* 到达低谷处，此时力为 0，但动能极大，有正向速度，因此会继续往右运动；但斜率为正，力为负，则意味着接下来要逐渐减速
* 到达峰顶位置。。。。

We have this formula. So at every moment, the force on the particle is this. So the equation of motion is mx double dot is equal to minus du dx. So let us see what it means. The total energy is here. At this point, the kinetic energy is this distance. So at this point, there's no kinetic energy. Let's say it's not moving. Velocity is zero. At this point, du dx is negative. So minus du dx is positive. That means the force is positive.（我们有这个公式。因此，在每一时刻，粒子所受的力就是这个。所以运动方程是mx的双点等于负的du dx。让我们看看这意味着什么。总能量在这里。在这一点上，动能是这个距离。因此，在这一点上，没有动能。假设它没有移动。速度为零。在这一点上，du dx是负的。所以负的du dx是正的。这意味着力是正的。）

So that means that it pushes it in this direction. So it goes faster and faster. So the kinetic energy increases. At this point, the kinetic energy reaches a maximum. The slope is zero. That means the force is zero. So at that point, the particle is suffering no force at all.(这意味着它朝这个方向推动。所以它越来越快。因此动能增加。此时，动能达到最大值。斜率为零。这意味着力为零。所以在那一点上，粒子完全没有受到任何力。)

But it has a velocity which is going in a positive x direction, so it will move to the next point. At that point, the slope becomes positive, so the force becomes negative. That means, although it's still moving in the x direction, but it's suffering a force opposing it.(但它有一个正向x方向的速度，因此会移动到下一个点。在那个点上，斜率变为正，所以力变为负。这意味着，尽管它仍在x方向上移动，但它受到一个与之相反的力。)

![[81.png|300]]

* 到达峰顶位置，此时速度减到极小，动能达到极小值（垂线高度差小），接下来力又开始变大，
* 再到谷底，达到动能极大值，力再次为负，逐渐减速
* 到达最右侧的交点后，势能再次等于总能量，则动能为 0，此时速度减小为 0
* 此时力是负的，则随后，小球开始向左运动，反向回去，实现来回振动

Therefore, it slows down, and indeed you see that it goes slower and slower, until it reaches this point. At that point, the force is zero again, because the slope is horizontal. After which, it increases again, because the slope is negative, and therefore the force is positive.(因此，它逐渐减速，实际上你会看到它变得越来越慢，直到到达这一点。在这一点上，力再次为零，因为斜率为水平。之后，力再次增加，因为斜率为负，因此力为正。)

So it begins to accelerate, until this point, where it has an even larger kinetic energy. And then it slows down again, because it has a negative force, until it reaches this point, when the velocity becomes zero. And the slope is positive, so therefore the force is negative.(于是它开始加速，直到这一点，此时它具有更大的动能。然后它再次减速，因为它受到一个负力，直到到达这一点，此时速度变为零。斜率为正，因此力为负。)

That means it reaches a point where it's no longer moving, but it suffers a force pushing backwards, so therefore it begins to oscillate back. So therefore, you see that it oscillates between these two. Now, what I said in the last few minutes is very simple, and it's very obvious.(这意味着它达到了一个不再移动的点，但受到一个向后推的力，因此它开始向后振荡。因此，你会看到它在这两者之间来回振荡。我刚才说的这几分钟的内容非常简单，也非常明显。)

#### 复盘上节课讲解失误处（滑梯曲线 VS. 势能曲线）

But go through it again in your mind, so that whenever you see a diagram like this, you would immediately, intuitively know the precise meaning of the motion and the force at each point. Now last time, we talked about this curve, but I made a mistake. You may or may not remember. I first, I was talking about a slide. Now let us, this is a potential energy curve. So this is a potential energy diagram.(但在脑海中再回顾一遍，这样当你再看到类似的图示时，就能立刻直观地理解每个点的运动和力的确切含义。上次我们讨论过这条曲线，但我犯了个错误——你可能记得也可能不记得——我一开始说的是滑梯。现在让我们明确：这是一条势能曲线，也就是势能示意图。)

Now let us talk about a different problem. The different problem is that we have a slide. When I started on that part of the discussion last time, I had one idea, without having thought it through. I said that this and this, because it looks similar, are the same problem, but it's not. So halfway through, I realized the mistake, so I asked you to scratch out what I said, and we started anew on this. Now let us go back to this and ask, analyze this more in depth, so that we understand precisely where the mistake is.(现在让我们来讨论一个不同的问题。这个不同的问题是我们有一个滑梯。上次我开始讨论这部分时，我未经深思熟虑就产生了一个想法。我说这个和那个看起来相似，所以是同一个问题，但其实不是。所以在讨论到一半时，我意识到了这个错误，于是我让你们把我说的划掉，我们重新开始讨论这个问题。现在让我们回到这个问题，更深入地分析和探讨，以便我们准确理解错误出在哪里。)

In this case, the total energy, for example, the total energy is equal to the potential energy, and the potential energy is mgz. In this case, this is z. This is x. It's a slide. This is the potential energy. The difference is the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is one-half of mv squared. v consists of vx squared plus vy squared, plus vz squared.(在这种情况下，总能量，例如总能量等于势能，而势能是mgz。在这里，这是z。这是x。这是一个斜面。这就是势能。其差值就是动能。动能等于二分之一mv平方。v由vx平方加vy平方加vz平方组成。)

上节课中被划掉的案例，我们现在深入分析一下当时案例错误在哪里，为什么被划掉了。

现在这个图是个滑梯，纵轴表示的是 $z(x)$，而不是 $U(x)$

$$\begin{align} 
E &= mgz + \frac{1}{2}m(v_{x}^2+v_{z}^2) \\
&=mgz+\frac{1}{2}m\left(\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)^2+\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)^2\right) \\
&=U(x)+\frac{1}{2}m\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)^2\left[ 1+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}x} \right)^2\right]
\end{align} $$
在这个公式中最后多了一部分东西，所以这是不同的东西，所以上节课中把这个划掉了。


Now what is the vx? It's dx dt. This part is u of x. z is a function of x, plus one-half m dx dt squared, times one plus dz. So the mathematics of this problem is different from the mathematics of this problem In the potential energy problem, there is no such a term. In this case, the energy is equal to u of x plus one-half dx dt squared. So when you look at these two, there is this term, and that's where, in the middle of my explanation last time, I realized that they are different. So I asked you to scratch out this.(那么vx是什么呢？它是dx/dt。这部分是u(x)。z是x的函数，加上½m(dx/dt)²，乘以(1+dz)。所以这个问题的数学处理与势能问题不同——在势能问题里没有这一项。这里能量等于u(x)加上½(dx/dt)²。因此当你对比两者时，会发现这一项的存在，这也正是我上回讲解到一半时意识到它们不同的地方，所以让你们把这部分划掉。)

### checkpoint 例题（easy）

Any questions? There is a, on page 154, there is a checkpoint five. Let's discuss that. It talks about a surface which has friction. And there's a block which is pushed with a force. And the table gives, the book gives you several possibilities. If the force is five newton, seven newton, and eight newton, it travels a certain distance, a fixed distance.(有什么问题吗？在第 154 页有一个第五检查点。我们来讨论一下。它讲的是一个有摩擦力的表面。还有一个被施加力的木块。表格中，书里给出了几种可能性。如果力是 5 牛顿、7 牛顿和 8 牛顿，它会移动一定的距离，一个固定的距离。)

It travels a distance d. Velocity. If you push it with a five newton force, the velocity, the book says that the velocity decreases. If you push it with a seven newton force, the velocity is constant. If you push it with an eight newton force, the velocity increases. This is, of course, completely in agreement with our intuition. The block is on a frictional surface, so there is a frictional force.(它移动了一段距离 d。速度。如果你用五牛顿的力推它，书上说速度会减小。如果你用七牛顿的力推它，速度保持不变。如果你用八牛顿的力推它，速度会增加。这当然完全符合我们的直觉。木块在一个有摩擦力的表面上，所以存在摩擦力。)

The frictional force, a kinetic frictional force, is equal to mu times the normal force. The normal force is fixed, is the weight of the block. Mu times that constant force, so it's a fixed number. That fixed number is the frictional force. So what is the frictional force? According to this table, the frictional force is seven newtons. How do I know? Because if I push it with a seven newton force, it exactly cancels the frictional force, so therefore the velocity remains constant, no acceleration.(摩擦力，即动摩擦力，等于摩擦系数乘以正压力。正压力是固定的，等于木块的重量。摩擦系数乘以这个恒定的力，所以它是一个固定值。这个固定值就是摩擦力。那么摩擦力是多少呢？根据这个表格，摩擦力是 7 牛顿。我是怎么知道的？因为如果我施加7牛顿的力来推动它，它正好抵消了摩擦力，因此速度保持恒定，没有加速度。)

So we know the frictional force in this case is seven newtons. If I push it with only five newton force, then the friction is stronger than my force, so therefore it slows down, so it accelerates. If I push it with eight newton force, my pushing is stronger than the friction, so therefore it would increase, so therefore it's this.(所以我们知道在这种情况下摩擦力是七牛顿。如果我仅用五牛顿的力推它，那么摩擦力比我的力大，因此它会减速，也就是加速（负方向）。如果我以八牛顿的力推它，我的推力比摩擦力大，因此它会加速，也就是这样。)

Now, how much energy do I spend in the distance of d? How much work do I do? In this case, it's five d. In this case, if it travels the same distance, so the work done. In this case, it's five d. In this case, it's seven d. In this case, it's eight d. In this case, I do more work than this case. In this case, I do more work than this. What happens to that work? It becomes heat. So there's more heat generated in this case than this case. This case has more heat generated than this case.(那么，在距离 d 内我消耗了多少能量？我做了多少功？在这种情况下，做功是 5d。这种情况下，如果移动相同的距离，所做的功是 5d。这种情况下是 7d。这种情况下是 8d。这种情况下我做的功比这种情况多。这种情况下我做的功比这种情况多。这些功变成了什么？它变成了热量。所以这种情况下产生的热量比这种情况多。这种情况产生的热量比这种情况多。)

### 例题 1

![[Pasted image 20251109143255.png|200]]

（对应 12 版教材 53P，在图中，一个质量为 3.5 kg 的物块从静止开始，被一个劲度系数为 640 N/m 的压缩弹簧加速。物块在弹簧达到其原长时离开弹簧，随后在一个动摩擦系数 $μ_k​=0.25$ 的水平地面上运动。摩擦力使物块在移动了 $D=7.8$ m 的距离后停止。求：(a) 物块-地面系统热能的增量；(b) 物块的最大动能；(c) 弹簧最初的压缩距离。

可自行求解，下方解题思路不予整理，可能存在因口语或转录等细节不准的情况。此处只提供最终答案，供对比使用。  （a）67J，（b）67J，（c）0.46m）

So it's a very elementary problem. Now let's try 51P. 51P talks about a block, a compressed block, which originally V is equal to zero. So the sphere would expand, and so it would go to this point. This is where it's natural. The sphere comes to the natural position. From this point on, there's going to be friction. So this part of the table has friction. Before that, it's assumed that there is no friction.(这是一个非常基础的问题。现在让我们来看 51P 题。51P 题讨论的是一个压缩的方块，初始速度 $v=0$。弹簧会膨胀，因此会到达这一点。这是它的自然位置。弹簧到达自然位置后，就会开始产生摩擦力。因此桌子的这一部分有摩擦。在此之前，假设是没有摩擦的。)

So this first part has no friction. And in this frictional surface, it moves this distance. It moves a distance L. L is equal to 7.8 meters. It moves 7.8 meters along a frictional surface, and the new kinetic is equal to 0.25. The spring constant is equal to 640 newtons per meter. The mass is equal to 3.5 kilograms. Now first, let's ask, at this point, the spring has a velocity.(所以第一部分没有摩擦力。在这个有摩擦力的表面上，它移动了这段距离。它移动了距离 L。$L=7.8$ 米。它在有摩擦力的表面上移动了 7.8 米，动摩擦系数 $\mu_{k}=0.25$。弹簧常数为 640 牛顿每米。质量为 3.5 千克。现在首先，让我们问一下，在这一点上，弹簧有一个速度。)

The velocity comes because originally there is a potential energy stored, no kinetic energy. Here, there's no more potential energy for the spring, so all the energy becomes the velocity. And the energy there is equal to one-half mv squared.(速度之所以产生，是因为最初储存着势能而没有动能。此时，弹簧已不再具有势能，因此所有能量都转化为速度。而这里的能量等于 $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$。)

We don't know what V is at this moment. Now, during the latter part of the motion, what is the force? The force is equal to mu, which is known, times the normal force between the block and the table, and that's mg. But we also know this is equal to ma.(我们目前还不清楚V是什么。现在，在运动的后期阶段，作用力是多少？作用力等于已知的摩擦系数 $μ$ 乘以木块与桌面之间的法向力，也就是 $mg$。但我们还知道这等于 $ma$。)

a is negative, but we are talking about the magnitude of a. So we know the acceleration. Acceleration is mu g over m. No mu, no m. It's equal to mu g. So we have a block which is negatively accelerated, and it comes to a stop. Now I want you to remember, for motions with constant acceleration, there are two formulas which involve t. V is equal to V0 plus at.($a$ 是负的，但我们在讨论 $a$ 的大小。所以我们知道加速度。加速度等于 $μg$。所以我们有一个负加速度的块，它会停下来。现在我希望你记住，对于匀加速运动，有两个涉及t的公式。$v=v_0+at$。)

The other formula that's important is distance is equal to x is equal to x0 plus V0t plus one-half at squared. These two formulas involving t, you should always remember. But there's another formula which is very important which doesn't involve t, and that tells you the kinetic energy difference.(另一个重要的公式是距离等于$x=x_0+v_0 t+1/2 at^2$。这两个涉及 $t$ 的公式你应该永远记住。但还有一个非常重要的公式不涉及 $t$，它告诉你动能的变化。)

So it's V, and this formula, V squared minus V0 squared is equal to 2as. The final velocity squared minus the initial velocity squared is equal to 2a times the distance traveled. You can have various ways of remembering this. But anyway, this is a very important, very useful formula. It, of course, can be derived from those two equations involving t, which are more fundamental in some sense. Okay, let's apply that to this.(所以这是V，而这个公式，$v^2-v_{0}^2=2ax$。末速度的平方减去初速度的平方等于 $2a$ 乘以移动的距离。你可以用各种方式来记忆这个公式。但无论如何，这是一个非常重要、非常有用的公式。当然，它可以从那两个涉及时间 $t$ 的方程中推导出来，从某种意义上说，那两个方程更为基础。好了，让我们把它应用到这里。)

So one shouldn't say it's V squared minus V0 squared. The larger V squared minus the smaller V squared is equal to 2as, where a is the absolute value of the acceleration and s is the distance traveled. So now at this point the velocity is zero.(所以不能说它是V的平方减去V0的平方。较大的V平方减去较小的V平方等于2as，其中a是加速度的绝对值，s是行驶的距离。所以在这一点上速度为零。)

So we have a V squared is equal to 2 times a, a is equal to mu g, s is equal to L. And the problem requires you to calculate the energy. And the energy is the energy is equal to one half. And V squared is equal to one half. And to you. So this is a. He asks you for the key and we have the same answer. Now that we know the final velocity, he asks you how much smooth surface did the spring travel? You just equate to the energy, the final energy of the of the smooth motion part.(所以我们有V的平方等于2乘以a，a等于μ乘以g，s等于L。题目要求你计算能量。能量等于二分之一乘以V的平方，也就是二分之一乘以a。他问你关键点是什么，我们得到了相同的答案。既然我们已经知道了最终速度，他问你弹簧在光滑表面上移动了多远？你只需要将能量等同于光滑运动部分的最终能量即可。)

The final energy, the kinetic energy plus zero. That's equal to the total energy is equal to the initial. The initial, the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is one half K times the distance squared. We call that distance from here to here, that distance D. So knowing all these quantities, you can calculate D. So D is equal to MV squared over K. And since V already is known, so. OK, let's try that. (最终的能量，即动能加零，等于总能量，等于初始能量。初始时，动能为零。势能为二分之一K乘以距离的平方。我们称从这里到这里的距离为D。知道了所有这些量，你就可以计算出D。因此，D等于MV的平方除以K。既然V已经已知，那么。好的，让我们试试看。)


### 例题 2

（图略，自行想象）

There are some somewhat tricky questions. Let's go to 54P. It's a mass of 40 kilograms pushing up a surface where the kinetic friction is zero point three zero. Now, if you resolve the force, the gravitational force consists of a component which is perpendicular to the surface and a component which is parallel to the surface. That's one of the forces. The other force is the reaction.(这里有一些稍微棘手的问题。让我们来看第 54P。一个 40 公斤的物体在一个表面上向上推，动摩擦系数为 0.30。现在，如果你分解这个力，重力可以分为垂直于表面的分量和平行于表面的分量。这是其中一个力。另一个力是反作用力。)

Since there's no acceleration perpendicular to the surface, so the two forces perpendicular to the surface must balance. So R has to be equal to. This is MG.  This is MG. This angle is 30 degrees, right? Yes. So this is MG cosine 30 degrees. And this is MG sine 30 degrees. So R has to be equal to MG cosine 30 degrees. What is the force? The component of force on block parallel to the surface. It has two components. One is the gravitational force component. So it's MG sine 30 degrees.(由于垂直于表面没有加速度，所以垂直于表面的两个力必须平衡。因此，R必须等于。这是MG。这是MG。这个角度是30度，对吧？是的。所以这是MG乘以cos30度。而这是MG乘以sin30度。因此，R必须等于MG乘以cos30度。力是多少？作用在块体上平行于表面的力分量。它有两个分量。一个是重力的分量。所以是MG乘以sin30度。)

That's downwards, so minus. And it has another component, which is the frictional force. The frictional force is equal to mu times MG, times MG cosine 30 degrees. MG 30 degrees is the R. According to the frictional law, you multiply that by mu, you get the frictional force. And that frictional force is downwards. And that is equal to the acceleration.(这是向下的，所以是负的。它还有另一个分量，就是摩擦力。摩擦力等于μ乘以MG，再乘以MG乘以cos30度。MG乘以cos30度就是R。根据摩擦定律，将其乘以μ，就得到了摩擦力。这个摩擦力也是向下的。它等于加速度。)

So the acceleration is equal to minus G sine 30 degrees minus mu G cosine 30 degrees. If the origin of the velocity is V, if it's pushed up a distance, D, and stops, we'll use that formula, V squared minus V zero squared is equal to 2AS. So therefore, we get V squared minus zero squared is equal to 2 times this number times this number, which is equal to 2G sine 30 degrees is one-half, plus mu cosine 30 degrees is one-half of square root of 3 times D. If you know the velocity, you know the energy.(因此，加速度等于负G乘以sin30度减去摩擦系数μ乘以G乘以cos30度。如果初速度为V，当物体被向上推动距离D后停止，我们将使用公式V平方减去V零平方等于2AS。因此，我们得到V平方减去零平方等于2乘以这个数再乘以这个数，即2G乘以sin30度（等于1/2），加上摩擦系数μ乘以cos30度（等于√3/2）再乘以D。如果知道速度，就能知道能量。)


### 例题 3

![[Pasted image 20251109144900.png|200]]

（对应 12 版教材第八章第 65 题，一个质点可沿一条两端隆起、中间平坦的轨道滑动。平坦部分的长度 $L = 40\mathrm{cm}$。轨道的弯曲部分无摩擦，但平坦部分的动摩擦因数为 $\mu_{k} = 0.20$。质点从点 A 由静止释放，点 A 的高度 $h = L/2$。质点最终停止在距离平坦部分左边缘多远的地方？）

I assigned quite a few exercises from this chapter. Some of them are very interesting. Let's try one more. This talks about the arrangement where these two parts are smooth, no friction. This part has friction. The friction has a coefficient of 2.0, 0.20, sorry. It has a length of L and H is equal to half of L. So this particle starts from this point. It slides down this smooth surface. So at this point, it has a certain velocity.(我布置了这一章的不少习题。其中一些非常有趣。让我们再试一道。这道题讲的是这两个部分光滑无摩擦的排列。这部分有摩擦。摩擦系数是2.0，抱歉，是 0.20。它的长度是L，H等于L的一半。所以这个质点从这个点开始。它沿着这个光滑的表面滑下。因此在这个点，它有一定的速度。)

Let's call that V1. And after that, it is slowed down because there's friction on this surface. And it would have a V2 here. And then it slides to go up here and then come down again. Now, if the velocity is V2 forward, after it comes up and slides back down again, its velocity would be going the other way. What's the magnitude of this new velocity? Does anybody know what should be the new velocity? Is it going to be more or less than the original velocity? Come on, somebody must answer this.(我们把这个速度称为V1。之后，由于表面摩擦力的作用，速度会减慢。在这里它的速度会是V2。然后它会滑上去再滑下来。现在，如果向前滑动的速度是V2，那么在它滑上去又滑下来之后，速度的方向会相反。这个新速度的大小是多少？有人知道新速度应该是多少吗？它会比原来的速度大还是小？来吧，必须有人回答这个问题。)

Let me repeat. Here's a particle with a velocity V2, positive. And it goes up and it reaches, it's gradually being slowed down until its velocity is 0. Then it reverses itself and comes back to this point, at which point, of course, it's traveling the other way.(让我再重复一遍。这里有一个粒子，速度为V2，正值。它向上运动，逐渐减速直到速度降为零。然后它反向运动，回到这一点，此时当然是以相反方向运动。)

If the original velocity is V2, what is the velocity after it comes back? It has to be also V2 or it changes sign. How do you know it's the same? Because of concentration of energy. The original energy is one half m V2 squared.(如果初速度为V2，反弹后的速度是多少？它必须也是V2或者改变符号。你怎么知道它是相同的？因为能量守恒。初始能量是二分之一m乘以V2的平方。)

Finally, the energy has to be the same because total energy is conserved. The potential energy, of course, has not changed because Z is the same. So the total kinetic energy at that point, whether it's going this way or this way, has to be the same.(最终，能量必须相同，因为总能量是守恒的。当然，势能没有改变，因为Z是相同的。因此，在那个点的总动能，无论它朝这个方向还是那个方向运动，都必须相同。)

And therefore, V2, it just changes sign. Okay, so then it comes back to this point. And then it gets slowed down. And then it climbs up like this and comes back again. And so on and so forth, it goes back and forth. The problem first asks you, well, eventually it has to stop down because every time it goes through the frictional surface, it would be slowed down.(因此，V2 只是改变了符号。好的，所以它又回到了这个点。然后它被减速了。接着它像这样爬升，然后又回来了。如此往复，它来回运动。问题首先问你，最终它必须停下来，因为每次经过摩擦表面时，它都会被减速。)

The question is, where does it stop? Okay, let's try this one. The first, the original energy, the original kinetic and mechanical energy, that means potential plus kinetic, is equal to mgh, and that's equal to one-half of mv1 squared. Right, because the difference of the potential energy between these two is mgh, and that is completely converted to kinetic energy, so it's one-half mv squared.（问题是，它会在哪里停止？好吧，让我们试试这个。最初的、原始的动能和机械能，也就是势能加动能，等于mgh，这等于二分之一mv1的平方。没错，因为这两者之间的势能差是mgh，而这完全转化为动能，所以是二分之一mv的平方。）

从左侧光滑曲面滑下来，势能转为动能：
$$E=mgh=\frac{1}{2}mv_{1}^2 \quad\quad v_{1}^2=2gh$$
这里的 $v_{1}$ 是指从左侧曲面滑下来刚进入平面时的速度，在摩擦平面：$$a=-\mu g$$
So therefore, we know v1 squared is equal to 2gh. Now, what is the acceleration in this frictional part? The normal force is mg, so that's the first part. The normal force is mg multiplied by mu, that is the acceleration. The acceleration is equal to minus this quantity. Therefore, A is equal to minus mu g. We do not know whether it would stop in the middle. Here we have a particle with velocity v1.（因此，我们知道v1的平方等于2gh。那么，在摩擦部分的加速度是多少呢？法向力是mg，这是第一部分。法向力是mg乘以μ，这就是加速度。加速度等于这个量的负值。因此，A等于负μ乘以g。我们不知道它是否会在中间停止。这里我们有一个速度为v1的粒子。）

It travels along this frictional surface with an acceleration of minus mu g. So let us forget about this configuration and just ask this question. A particle with velocity v1 here, traveling along a surface with mu equal to this, and eventually, forget about this is infinitely long. We imagine it's infinitely long, and ask where does it stop? So eventually it will stop.（它以负μg的加速度沿着这个摩擦表面运动。因此，让我们忘记这个配置，只问这个问题。一个速度为v1的粒子在这里，沿着μ等于这个值的表面运动，最终，忘记这个表面是无限长的。我们想象它是无限长的，然后问它在哪里停止？所以最终它会停止。）

假设摩擦平面无限长，终究速度为减为 0，求滑动距离 $D$，显然：

$$0^2-v_{1}^2=2(-\mu g) D\quad\quad D=\frac{v_{1}^2}{2\mu g}=\frac{2gh}{2\mu g}=\frac{h}{\mu}$$
题中 $\mu=0.2,h=\frac{1}{2}L$，所以 $D=5h=\frac{5}{2}L$


If it's an infinitely long frictional surface, it will stop somewhere. Where? Okay, so let this distance be called D. Then the velocity here squared, v1 squared, minus the velocity here squared, is equal to 2 times A, which is mu g, times D. So what is this? So we get D is equal to v1 squared over 2 mu g, which is 2gh divided by 2 mu g, which is equal to g over mu, which is equal to h over mu. Now mu is 0.20, so 1 over mu is 5, so it's 5h.（如果是一个无限长的摩擦表面，它最终会在某处停下来。具体在哪里呢？好的，我们设这段距离为D。那么这里的速度平方，v1的平方，减去这里的速度平方，等于2乘以A（即μ乘以g），再乘以D。这是什么意思呢？所以我们得到D等于v1的平方除以2μ乘以g，也就是2gh除以2μ乘以g，等于g除以μ，等于h除以μ。现在μ是0.20，所以1除以μ等于5，因此距离就是5h。）

5h is equal to 5 over 2l. So that means that if it goes along this way, it will have a distance equal to 5 over 2l. That is larger than l. We just computed it. So what does that mean? That means that the v1 in traveling along here, when it reaches this point, it has not stopped yet. What I just have done here is merely to test whether it stops before it reaches that point, but we have proven that left alone it will continue to go a distance of 5h over 2l, which is much longer than l, so therefore it stops at this point. It has not stopped yet.（5h等于5除以2l。这意味着如果它沿着这个方向移动，它将走过的距离等于5除以2l。这个距离比l要大。我们刚刚计算过了。那么这意味着什么呢？这意味着v1在沿着这条路径移动时，当它到达这一点时，它还没有停止。我刚才所做的只是测试它是否会在到达那一点之前停止，但我们已经证明，如果不加干预，它将继续移动5h除以2l的距离，这比l要长得多，因此它会在这一点停止。它还没有停止。）

计算出来的 $D=\frac{5}{2}L>L$，所以会继续向右以 $v_{2}$ 速度进入无摩擦轨道滑行，并以相同速度再次经过最低点反向滑行，至于能不能再次滑到左侧曲面还是就直接停在中间某处了，此处就不再进行了，留给你作为练习。

$$v_{2}^2-v_{1}^2=2(-\mu g)L\quad\quad v_{2}^2=2gh-2\mu gL=gL-0.4gL=0.6gL$$

So now let's ask what is v2? So here we have v1 squared minus v2 squared is equal to 2 times a, which is mu g, times the distance. The distance is l, so we know what is v2. v2 squared is equal to v1 squared minus 2 mu g l. Now, v1 squared is 2dh minus 2 mu g l. 2 mu g l. That is equal to g l minus 2 minus 0.4 g l. So that is equal to 0.6 g l. So at this point, it still has a velocity.（那么现在我们来问v2是什么？这里我们有v1的平方减去v2的平方等于2乘以a（即μ乘以g）再乘以距离。距离是l，所以我们知道v2是什么。v2的平方等于v1的平方减去2μgl。现在，v1的平方是2dh减去2μgl。2μgl。这等于gl减去2减去0.4gl。所以这等于0.6gl。所以在这一点上，它仍然有一个速度。）

If we didn't do this, if we didn't do that analysis that we tried, namely assuming that it goes along without going up, it would go a distance of 5h. If indeed you immediately try this, you would get this velocity. But if it stops in the middle, if the problem were essentially stopped in the middle, at this point you would get the v2 squared, which is negative.(如果我们不这样做，如果我们不进行我们尝试的那种分析，即假设它沿着不上升的方向前进，它会行进5/2h的距离。如果你真的立即尝试这个，你会得到这个速度。但如果它在中间停止，如果问题本质上在中间停止，在这一点上你会得到v2的平方，这是负的。)

这里提到的第二种思路是，你无须先假设摩擦平面无限长，看它能滑多远，能不能通过 $L$，你可以直接求 $v_{2}$ 处的速度（隐含假设能通过 $L$），如果算出来的 $v_{2}^2 \geq 0$，那没问题，确实可以通过 $L$，如果算出来的 $v_{2}^2<0$，则说明停在中间某处

That means that it does not follow the whole l. So you don't have to do this analysis which I just did. By just directly going to here and calculate the v2 squared, if it comes up positive, you know that it reaches the end. If it comes to negative, you know it has stopped in the middle. Okay, now if you climb up here, and it comes back, and it comes back with the same velocity, only in reverse direction as we said before. And then you do this back and forth, back and forth. Eventually, you would get the result.(这意味着它不会遵循整个 l。所以你不需要像我刚才那样进行分析。直接到这里计算 v2 的平方，如果结果是正的，你就知道它到达了终点。如果是负的，你就知道它在中间停止了。好的，现在如果你爬到这里，它又回来了，而且是以相同的速度回来，只是方向相反，就像我们之前说的那样。然后你来回这样做，来回反复。最终，你会得到结果。)

I will not go through with this. The conclusion is that it comes here, it climbs up this, it comes up here, climbs again, then it comes back again, and stops in the middle of the track. Follow this through. I'm not going to go to the end, but follow what I just said through. It's a very interesting exercise. (我不会继续下去了。结论是它来到这里，爬上这个，再爬到这里，再爬一次，然后又回来，停在轨道中间。按照这个思路走一遍。我不会走到最后，但按照我刚才说的走一遍。这是一个非常有趣的练习。)

### 例题 4

![[83.png]]

如图，左侧有一个滑道，高度是 $5r$，底部有一个半径为 $r$ 的圆形轨道

Okay, now let's try another one. This one is also a little bit tricky. It has a slide which is 5r in height. At this point, it goes into a circle of radius r. So the particle slides down the slide, and it goes very fast at the bottom, and then it goes up.(好了，现在让我们试试另一个。这个也有点棘手。它有一个高度为 $5r$ 的滑道。在这一点上，它进入一个半径为 $r$ 的圆形轨道。所以粒子从滑道上滑下，在底部速度非常快，然后上升。)

So first, what it wants to ask is, what is the velocity? What happens to the particle at this point? First, we do not yet know whether it will reach this point, but let us assume that it does reach that point, because it might have fallen off the slide. Suppose it does reach this point, then one-half of mv squared has to be equal to the potential energy, which has been lost. The total height is 5r.(首先，它要问的是，在圆的最高点（高度 $2r$）速度是多少？粒子在这一点会发生什么？首先，我们尚不清楚它是否会到达这一点，但让我们假设它确实到达了这一点，因为它可能已经从滑道上滑落。假设它确实到达了这一点，那么二分之一mv平方必须等于已经损失的重力势能。总高度为5r。)

假设能滑到最高点，最高点处的动能=从轨道初始点下滑过程中损失的重力势能，即$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2=(5mgr-2mgr) \quad\quad v^2=6gr$$
The slide from this circle from here to here is 2r. So therefore, 3r is the potential energy lost. So 3mg times r. mg times 3r is the potential energy lost. That is equal to the kinetic energy. So therefore, we know what is v squared. It's 6gr. Now at this point, let us analyze its force. At this point, here we have to let this point be called A. The force on the particle consists of two terms. One is the reaction.(这个圆从这里到这里的滑动距离是2r。因此，势能损失为3r。即3mg乘以r。mg乘以3r就是损失的势能。这等于动能。因此，我们知道v的平方等于6gr。现在在这一点，让我们分析它的受力。在这一点，我们称之为A点。质点所受的力由两部分组成。一个是反作用力。)

然后对最高点做受力分析，有两个（或一个）力，重力和来自圆形轨道的反作用力（不一定存在）

One is mg, the gravitational force. The other is the reaction. It's supposed to be a smooth slide, so there is no horizontal component of the reaction force. So there's only two forces, r and mg. Both of them are downwards. r plus mg is equal to the total force. Now here we have to use a formula that we derived twice a few times back. If you have a particle going through a motion, which is not necessarily uniform, but it's circular. It's a circular motion, non-uniform.(一个是mg，即重力。另一个是反作用力。这应该是一个平滑的滑动，因此反作用力没有水平分量。所以只有两个力，r和mg。它们都是向下的。r加上mg等于总力。现在这里我们必须使用一个我们之前推导过几次的公式。如果你有一个粒子在做运动，不一定是匀速的，但它是圆周运动。这是一个非匀速的圆周运动。)

向心加速度计算公式 $$a=\frac{v^2}{r}$$对于非匀速圆周运动同样适用，只不过对于非匀速圆周还存在切向加速度而已。所以在最高点，垂直方向的加速度就是向心加速度，所以 $$R+mg=m \frac{v^2}{r}=6mg\quad\quad R=5mg$$得出的结果 $R\geq 0$，说明轨道反作用力存在，这就没问题，确实可以达到最高点，而不至于半路坠落。

We have the formula about that acceleration, and the acceleration in the perpendicular direction is equal to v squared over r, independently of whether it's uniform or not. So this force has to go to mass. This force has to go to mass times v squared over r. Let me repeat.（我们掌握了关于这种加速度的公式，垂直方向的加速度等于v的平方除以r，无论它是否均匀。因此，这个力必须作用于质量。这个力必须等于质量乘以v的平方除以r。让我再重复一遍。）

For a non-uniform circular motion, the acceleration along the radial direction is v squared over r, independently of whether it's uniform or not. That statement is implied in the formula that we had derived several times. So now we can calculate r. So r is equal to minus mg plus mv squared over r. v squared over 6gr is equal to minus mg plus m, 6g. And therefore it's equal to 5mg. The most important thing here is that this is a positive. Why is that important? Well, just use your intuition.（对于非匀速圆周运动，沿径向的加速度始终等于v²/r，无论运动是否匀速。这一结论已隐含在我们多次推导的公式中。现在我们可以计算r值：r等于负mg加上mv²/r。将v²替换为6gr后，等式变为负mg加上m乘以6g，最终结果为5mg。关键在于这个结果是正值。为什么这点如此重要？不妨运用你的直觉来思考。）

If you were in the amusement park, and you pushed the track up, you would be at ease. But if the track became zero, you would be anxious, because you're going to fall. So r is greater than zero, which is very important. This proves that this thing has to go on. OK, that's the topic. Now let's change the topic a little bit.(如果你在游乐园里，把轨道往上推，你会感到安心。但如果轨道变成零，你就会焦虑，因为你即将坠落。所以 *R 大于零非常重要*。这证明这件事必须继续下去。好了，这就是题目。现在让我们稍微把题目改一改。)

#### 修改原题目，当 $h=nr,\,n<5$

What happens if h is less than 5r? For example, if h is equal to m. Just now m was equal to 5. OK. If you don't know how to calculate it, you know that if h is at the same level as the original, then you know that if you don't know how to calculate it, you know that if you slide down from here, it will reach this point and stop. Why? Because these two points have the same potential energy.(如果 $h<5r$ 会发生什么？例如，如果 $h=nR$。刚才 $n=5$。假如 $h$ 和圆形轨道的圆心平齐，那么你都不用算，你就知道如果你从这里滑下来，它会到达这个点并停止。为什么？因为这两个点具有相同的势能。)

当 $n=1$，即左侧滑道高度与圆心平齐，则只能滑道右侧相同高度，然后反向来回滑动；
当 $n<1$，自然也是左右滑动，来回震荡，但需要注意的是，这不是我们前面说的谐波

So the velocity of this point is equal to zero, and the velocity of this point is equal to zero. So it will slide back. That's why it turns like this. So this means that m is equal to 1. This is when m is equal to 1. So if m is less than 1, I totally know what's going on. If m is less than 1, it means that it starts from this point. Then it changes back and forth.（因此，这个点的速度等于零，而这个点的速度也等于零。所以它会向后滑动。这就是为什么它会这样转动。这是在 $n=1$ 的情况下。所以如果 $n<1$，我完全知道会发生什么。如果 $n<1$，这意味着它从这个点开始。然后它会来回变化。）

So if m is less than 1, it oscillates. Does everyone agree? This is not a harmonic, but nevertheless it oscillates. Why is it not a harmonic? Because this surface can look very strange. It can't be curved in the middle. It can't be like this. If you do this in the middle, then it won't work. It can't go over this. This is called a barrier. It can't go over this.(所以如果 $n<1$，它就会振荡。大家都同意吗？这不是谐波，但它确实在振荡。为什么它不是谐波呢？因为这个表面可以是很稀奇的样子，在中间不能拱起来，可能看起来非常奇怪，它不能在中间弯曲。如果你在中间这样做，那就不行了，这被称为障碍。它不能越过这个。)

> [!NOTE]
> 这个地方解释的稍微有点模糊，大概是说，对于此题而言，这个震荡轨道形状可以千奇百怪，可以有拱，比如锯齿状，只要满足任何高度不超过 $h$ 就好，而超过 $h$ 就会形成障碍，无法突破；而对于简谐振动，要求较高，力需要与位移成正比 $F=-kx$，势能函数必须是抛物线形状，对轨道形状要求特殊

So if m is less than 1, there is no problem. So now the interesting problem is that m is greater than 1. If m is greater than 1, then if it slides down from here, if we only discuss its energy, it can reach this point. But you can imagine that it will never do that. Because before it reaches that point, it will fall down. So when m is greater than 1, and m is not too big, this is the most interesting problem. So let's discuss this problem.(因此，如果 $n<1$，就没有问题。那么现在有趣的问题是 $n>1$ 的情况。如果 $n>1$，那么当它从这里滑下时，如果我们仅从能量角度讨论，它是可以到达这一点的。但你可以想象，它实际上永远无法做到。因为在到达那一点之前，它就会掉下来。所以*当 $n>1$，但又不是特别大时，这才是最有趣的问题*。让我们来讨论这个问题。)

仍关注圆形轨道最高点位置，此处的动能等于损失的势能，即

$$mg(n-2)r=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \quad\quad \frac{v^2}{r}=(2n-4)g$$
仍对这一点受力分析有：$$R+mg=m \frac{v^2}{r}=mg(2n-4)$$
可得：$$R=mg(2n-5)$$
Let's go back to what we were doing just now. So when it reaches this point, its kinetic energy, its potential energy lost, is m minus r. m times r. From here, this distance is nr. So the difference between this point and this point is n minus 2r. So this is its kinetic energy. So v square is equal to 2n minus 2rgl. So v square of r is the same as just now.（让我们回到刚才讨论的内容。当它到达这一点时，其动能（即损失的重力势能）等于m减去r，即m乘以r。从这里开始，这段距离是nr。因此，这一点与另一点之间的差值就是n减去2r。这就是它的动能。所以v的平方等于2n减去2rgl。因此，r处的v平方与刚才相同。）

v square of r is equal to 2n minus 4gl. So from the same equation just now, m times r plus m times g is equal to m times this. So r is equal to m times 2n minus 4 minus 1 is equal to m times 2n minus 5. So if 2n minus 5 is greater than 0, then there is no problem. r is greater than 0. You are very stable on the computer, so there is no problem. So this means that m is 2.5. So it is very likely that m is greater than 2.5, so there is no problem. But what if it is less than 2.5? So what if it is less than 2.5? We need to re-study this.(v的平方等于2n减去4gl。所以根据刚才的同一个方程，m乘以r加上m乘以g等于m乘以这个。因此，r等于m乘以2n减4减1，等于m乘以2n减5。所以如果2n减5大于0，那就没有问题。r大于0。你在上面很踏实，所以没有问题。这意味着 $n=2.5$。因此，$n$ 很可能大于2.5，所以没有问题。但如果小于2.5呢？如果小于2.5怎么办？我们需要重新研究这个问题。)

所以当 $n>2.5$ 时，轨道给你的压力为 $R>0$，你会感到踏实，没问题。而当 $n<2.5$ 时，肯定到不了最高点了，具体会怎么样？

Now let's study this point. This is theta. When theta is less than 90 degrees, it is not here yet. When theta is greater than 90 degrees, it goes up. When we calculate theta, it seems that theta is less than 90 degrees. But as you know, if you calculate it correctly, the result is the same whether it is less than 90 degrees or greater than 90 degrees.（现在我们来研究这一点。这是θ角。当θ小于90度时，它还没有到达这里。当θ大于90度时，它会上升。当我们计算θ时，似乎θ小于90度。但你知道，如果计算正确，无论θ小于90度还是大于90度，结果都是一样的。）

![[83.png]]

首先，在这一点上，动能是多少？还是要找势能损失了多少，这一点的高度显然是 $r-r\cos \theta$，所以有$$mg(n-1+\cos \theta)r=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \quad\quad \frac{v^2}{r}=2g(n-1+\cos \theta)$$
我们现在考虑的 $1<n<2.5$ 这个范围内。再次考虑力：$$R-mg\cos \theta=m \frac{v^2}{r}=2mg(n-1+\cos \theta)$$
所以：$$R=mg(2n-2+3\cos \theta)$$
So let's do this now. Now I want to ask what r is at this point. First, at this point, what is the kinetic energy? It falls from above. So nr minus r is the distance from the top to the center of the circle. Plus this part. This part is r cos theta. nr minus r is the loss from the top to the center of the circle. Plus this part. So this is the total distance. This quantity times mg is the total potential energy loss. This is equal to one-half mv squared. So v squared is equal to 2gr times n minus 1 plus cos theta.（那么我们现在就开始吧。现在我想问此时r的值是多少。首先，此时的动能是多少？它从上方落下。所以nr减去r就是从顶部到圆心的距离。再加上这部分。这部分是r乘以cosθ。nr减去r就是从顶部到圆心的下落距离。再加上这部分。所以这就是总的下落距离。这个量乘以mg就是总的重力势能损失。这等于1/2mv²。因此v²等于2gr乘以(n-1+cosθ)。）

So v squared over r is equal to 2g times n minus 1 plus cos theta. Now we are at n greater than 1. We have already talked about n less than 1. It is the oscillator. So now we are at n greater than 1 and 2.5. Now that we know the velocity, let's calculate the force. The force is the same as before. The reaction is in this direction. The reaction is minus.（因此，v的平方除以r等于2g乘以n减1加上cosθ。现在我们讨论n大于1的情况。之前我们已经讨论过n小于1的情形，那是振荡器的情况。所以现在我们在n大于1且等于2.5的情况下。既然我们已经知道了速度，接下来我们来计算力。这个力和之前是一样的。反作用力是朝这个方向的。反作用力是负的。）

The reaction is plus. Let me see. The force is like this. This force is this. This is theta. So this is mg. So mg cos theta. mg cos theta is like this. This is r. So r is minus. This is equal to the acceleration term. Using the non-uniform circular motion I just talked about, this is 2mg times n minus 1 plus cos theta. So what is r? r is equal to mg times 2n minus 2 plus 2 cos theta plus cos theta.（反应是正的。让我看看。力是这样的。这个力是这个。这是θ。所以这是mg。所以mg cosθ。mg cosθ是这样的。这是r。所以r是负的。这等于加速度项。用我刚才讲过的非匀速圆周运动，这是2mg乘以n减1加cosθ。那么r是什么？r等于mg乘以2n减2加2cosθ加cosθ。）

So it is equal to mg times 2n minus 2 plus 3 cos theta. This formula, although when we draw it, theta is less than 90 degrees, but it is also right when theta is greater than 90 degrees. When does theta greater than 90 degrees fall? This is when r is equal to 0. This is what I said just now. If you want to do this, you can do it. If you suddenly feel that you are not putting pressure on the track, you will know that it is dangerous. You will fall.（因此，它等于mg乘以2n减2加上3乘以cosθ。这个公式虽然在我们画图时θ小于90度，但当θ大于90度时也同样适用。θ大于90度的情况何时会发生？那就是当r等于0的时候。这就是我刚才说的。如果你想这样做，你可以这样做。如果你突然感觉到你没有对轨道施加压力，你就会知道这是危险的。你会掉下来。）

So r is equal to 0. This is where you fall. What is r equal to 0? This is equal to 0. So you get cos theta is equal to one third. 2 times 1 minus n. For example, when n is equal to five-fifths, cos theta is equal to negative one. So theta is equal to 180 degrees. So when n is equal to five-fifths, when it turns to 180 degrees, it falls. If n is equal to three-twos, cos theta is equal to negative one third.（因此，r等于0。这就是你坠落的地方。r等于0意味着什么？这意味着0。于是你得到cosθ等于三分之一。2乘以1减去n。例如，当n等于五分之五时，cosθ等于负一。因此θ等于180度。所以当n等于五分之五时，当它转到180度时，就会坠落。如果n等于三分之二，cosθ等于负三分之一。）

前面计算得到的结果：
$$R=mg(2n-2+3\cos \theta)$$

当 $R=0$ 的时候，就危险了，就会掉下来了，就会得到 $$\cos \theta = \frac{2-2n}{3}$$
比如说，当 $n=2.5$，$\cos \theta=-1$，$\theta=\pi$，即最高点坠落。比如 $n=1.5$，则 $\cos\theta=-\frac{1}{3}$，$\theta$ 大概在 110° 左右，即从这个角度位置坠落；而当 $n=1$，$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$，这个时候会沿着轨道回落。

So theta is equal to about 110 degrees. So when it turns to over 90 degrees, slightly over 20 degrees, it falls. When theta is equal to 1, cos theta is equal to 0. When n is equal to 1, cos theta is equal to 90 degrees. In this case, it is horizontal. So when you get there, it actually falls back. OK.(因此，θ约等于110度。当它超过90度，略高于20度时，就会倒下。当θ等于1时，cosθ等于0。当n等于1时，cosθ等于90度。在这种情况下，它是水平的。所以当你到达那里时，它实际上会回落。好的。)

I'm going to change the chapter. We're going to get to the next chapter. Chapter 9. I don't think I'm going to talk about it today. Two weeks ago, a few of my classmates gave me flowers. I said yes. I said I'd give two lectures. Now I'm going to have an extracurricular lecture, but it's limited to my classmates. Now I think it's like this. We have seven exams on November 1st. After the seven exams, for two weeks in a row, I'll give you 120 people two half-cursive lectures. As for the time, it's on the weekend or at night. These two professors will discuss with me. I hope I don't have enough time for your class. OK. Bye-bye.（我要换一章讲。我们要进入下一章了。第九章。我想今天就不讲这个了。两周前，几位同学送了我花。我答应了。我说会讲两次课。现在我要开个课外讲座，但仅限于我的同学。现在情况是这样的。11月1日我们有期中考试。这期中考试结束后，连续两周，我会给你们120人上两次半通俗讲座。至于时间，会在周末或晚上。这两位教授会和我商量。希望我时间不够给你们上课。好的。再见。）


-------------------

## 欧拉公式的推导

从泰勒级数开始：

$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \cdots$$

$$\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots$$

$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots$$

将 $x$ 替换为 $ix$：
$$e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \cdots$$

注意到 $i$ 的幂次规律：$i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, ...

$$e^{ix} = 1 + ix - \frac{x^2}{2!} - i\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + i\frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots$$

重新整理实部和虚部：
$$e^{ix} = \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots\right) + i\left(x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots\right)$$

因此得到**欧拉公式**：
$$e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x$$

#### 三角函数公式的证明

从欧拉公式：
- $e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x$ ... (1)
- $e^{-ix} = \cos(-x) + i\sin(-x) = \cos x - i\sin x$ ... (2)

将 (1) + (2)：
$$e^{ix} + e^{-ix} = 2\cos x$$

因此：$$\boxed{\cos x = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}}$$

将 (1) - (2)：
$$e^{ix} - e^{-ix} = 2i\sin x$$

因此：$$\boxed{\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}}$$

#### 与双曲函数的联系

双曲函数定义为：
$$\cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$$
$$\sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$

#### 重要联系

比较三角函数和双曲函数的公式：

$$\cos x = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$$

$$\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$

#### 神奇的变换关系

通过 $x \to ix$ 的替换：

$$\cos(ix) = \frac{e^{i(ix)} + e^{-i(ix)}}{2} = \frac{e^{-x} + e^{x}}{2} = \cosh x$$

$$\sin(ix) = \frac{e^{i(ix)} - e^{-i(ix)}}{2i} = \frac{e^{-x} - e^{x}}{2i} = \frac{i(e^x - e^{-x})}{2i} = i\sinh x$$

因此：
$$\boxed{\cos(ix) = \cosh x}$$
$$\boxed{\sin(ix) = i\sinh x}$$

反过来：
$$\boxed{\cosh(ix) = \cos x}$$
$$\boxed{\sinh(ix) = i\sin x}$$

#### 几何意义

- **三角函数**：描述单位圆上的点 $(x,y) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$
- **双曲函数**：描述单位双曲线 $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ 上的点 $(x,y) = (\cosh t, \sinh t)$

这种联系揭示了三角函数和双曲函数在复分析中的统一性！
