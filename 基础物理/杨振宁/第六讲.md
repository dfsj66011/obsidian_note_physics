Professor Ruan and Professor An Discussed with me I compared it all at once bout your situation Compared to I taught two big things at Stonebrook I think Satisfied Everyone to The attitude of doing CT With CT results All very good So this is very good Now there are some new Online For example, Syllabus 3 But this Syllabus 3 There is a picture This picture is Say it's a A projector The trajectory of a projector Do you have any comments on this picture? （阮教授和安教授与我讨论了我一次，比较了你的情况相比我在石溪教的两件大事我认为大家对做习题的态度与习题结果都非常好，所以这非常好，现在有一些新的在线内容例如教学大纲3但这个教学大纲3有一张图片这张图片说的是一个投影仪投影仪的轨迹你对这张图片有什么意见吗）


 This picture is not quite right Because he drew Not a parabola Parabola A little different from this Because parabola Its curvature Is getting more and more A parabola If you go down Almost straight He is This is my dense drawing He Did not put this parabola This concept Put in I think for a ball A circle The nature With a sine wave With a parabola You draw a few more of your own You know It can be seen that it is different （这幅图不太对，因为他画的不是抛物线。抛物线和这个有些不同，因为抛物线的曲率是越来越大的。如果你继续往下画，抛物线会变得几乎笔直。他画得比较密集，没有体现出抛物线的概念。我觉得对于一个球、一个圆来说，它的性质和正弦波、抛物线是不一样的。你多画几次就能看出它们的区别。）
 
 
 Let's talk about a Remember After we calculated for a while We got a formula This formula I will tell you now There is a method Can be recorded relatively simply Because What he did There is an R This R Turn it into a Dirichlet curve What state does it become? It becomes two One is R dot Another one Is R theta dot If you look at your When we calculated last time From R This vector After it becomes its Dirichlet It becomes two components One is in the original direction（我们来谈谈一个记忆点。经过一段时间的计算后，我们得到了一个公式。这个公式我现在就告诉你。有一种方法可以相对简单地记录下来。因为他所做的，有一个 $\vec{r}$。对其求导，它会变成两个部分：一个是 $\dot{r}$，另一个是 $r \dot{\theta}$。如果你回顾一下我们上次的计算，这个向量经过求导后，它会变成两个分量：一个保持原方向。）

> [!NOTE]
> 记住上节课 $\dot{r}$ 和 $\ddot{r}$ 的方法：你可以想象一个图，有一个矢量 $\vec{r}$，将其求导分解，第一项为 $\dot{r}$，方向与 $\vec{r}$ 一致，另一个垂直 90°，大小是 $r \dot{\theta}$。
> 然后可以把第一个分量，再次想象为和 $\vec{r}$ 一样，再次求导，又有两项，则相应的两项就分别是 $\ddot{r}$ 和 $\dot{r}\dot{\theta}$；然后第二个分量同理，也如此求导产生两项，第一个仍是保持与 $\vec{r}$ 成 90°，大小为 $\dot{(r \dot{\theta})}=\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r \ddot{\theta}$，另一个分量则再转 90°，即与 $\vec{r}$ 成 180° 的 $(r \dot{\theta})\dot{\theta}$
> 组合起来，在 $\hat{r}$ 方向上大小为 $\ddot{r}-r \dot{\theta}^2$，在 $\hat{\theta}$ 方向上则为 $2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}+r \ddot{\theta}$

But the magnitude is R dot One is at 90 degrees Is R theta dot So remember one R You want to become its time To become two Okay, let's call this one How much is this one Let me put this one The same thing Do it Is to take this one as This R The method just now What is its Dirichlet curve? Is to be divided into two One is R dot Dot again So it becomes R double dot Another one is R dot Rotate 90 degrees Multiply by theta dot So it becomes like this I just copied From R to these two Now it's not R It's R dot Of course it's like this This is this part What about the other part? I can't tell The other is R theta dot So its Its Derivative Is R theta dot dot I just said One thing is dot In its original direction Is the magnitude of its thing Dot, so this is it But there is another one It rotates 90 degrees Multiply by theta dot So it becomes this So this is R Theta dot Multiply by theta dot So It becomes four This is two, this is two Then I add it up Then you see In this R direction Which one is it? It's R double dot It comes from here With this negative R theta dot square In this theta direction There are two This is R dot theta dot Add up R theta dot Dot it again This is equal to （略，直接看公式）
  
OK, let's make a very simple example This is a swing This is called theta Then There is a swing which Swings back and forth If we analyze the force On this swing There is one force which is mg Going downwards There is another force Which is along the direction of the rope This direction But the sum of these two Has to be along the direction of the tangent（好的，让我们举一个非常简单的例子。这是一个秋千，摆动位置与竖直初始位置角度称为 θ。然后有一个来回摆动的秋千。如果我们分析这个秋千上的力，有一个向下的力 mg，另一个力沿着绳子的方向。但这两个力的合力必须沿着切线方向。）

秋千被限制在做圆周运动，所以 $\dot{r}=0$，径向上的速度为 0，则 $\ddot{r}=0$。则 $\vec{\ddot{r}}=\hat{r}(-r \dot{\theta}^2)+\hat{\theta}(r \ddot{\theta})$

Because if you take this formula Take this formula R double dot Let's look at it first R dot is equal to zero Because the swing The swing is confined to move On a circle Therefore R double dot is equal to zero So if you take this formula This is equal to zero So it is equal to So it is equal to R hat Multiplied by Minus R theta dot square Add up Theta hat R dot is zero This is R theta double dot Right（因为如果你采用这个公式 采用这个公式 R双点 我们先看看 R点等于零 因为摆动 摆动被限制在 一个圆周上运动 因此R双点等于零 所以如果你采用这个公式 这等于零 所以它等于 所以它等于 R帽 乘以 负Rθ点平方 加上 θ帽 R点为零 这是Rθ双点 对吧）

So Therefore its acceleration has two directions One is in the direction of R One is in the direction of theta Then its force Is in this direction The sum of these two is in this direction So if I take this force This force has one component Which is in the direction of R One component is in the direction of theta This component Balances the component of the tangent This is the component (因此，它的加速度有两个方向：一个是沿着R的方向，一个是沿着θ的方向。那么它的力就在这个方向上。这两个方向的合力就在这个方向上。所以如果我取这个力，这个力有一个分量是沿着R方向的，另一个分量是沿着θ方向的。这个分量平衡了切线的分量。这就是那个分量。)

在 $\hat{\theta}$ 方向上，重力的分量，$-mr \ddot{\theta}=mg \sin \theta$，得到 $\ddot{\theta}=-g\sin \theta / r$（这里负号的原因是 $\theta$ 增大的方向为 正，而重力的切线分量总是指向平衡位置 $\theta=0$，是个反的）。

So therefore we get The force M Multiplied by the acceleration R theta double dot That's equal to The component of Mg This is theta Times the sine theta R is negative Therefore theta double dot Is equal to minus g sine theta Over R If you write it like this It becomes like this This is called a differential equation Wave function（因此，我们得到力 M 乘以加速度 R θ 双点等于 Mg 的分量，即 θ 乘以 sin θ R 为负。因此，θ 双点等于 -g sin θ 除以 R。如果这样写，就变成了这样。这被称为微分方程。）$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\theta}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\frac{g}{r} \sin \theta$$
Wave function Is a very important subject i n differential and integral calculus, you'll be learning about Differential equations In your mathematics course We shall come back to this formula To solve a differential equation Is called to integrate it And there are several ways of integrating it But we'll come to that in the future(微分方程是微积分中一个非常重要的主题，你将在数学课程中学习微分方程。我们会回到这个公式来解微分方程，这被称为积分。积分有几种方法，但我们以后会讲到。)

 I think we better do some exercises Chapter 5 Problem 47p It talks about a monkey Climbing up, and this pulley has a weight of 15 kilograms on the other side. The monkey weighs 10 kilograms. So it's very simple.  Let's analyze what are the forces on the monkey. There's one force which is going downwards. That is the mass. Let's call this capital M and this small m. So there's a small mg. There's a force on monkey. And the other force is the tension on the rope.(我觉得我们最好做一下第五章的第 47 题练习。题目讲的是一只猴子向上爬，滑轮另一侧挂着一个15公斤的重物。猴子重10公斤。这很简单。我们来分析一下猴子受到的力。有一个向下的力，就是重力。我们把这个设为M，这个设为m。所以有一个小的mg作用在猴子身上。另一个力是绳子上的张力。)

So the monkey is climbing up. If the monkey doesn't do anything, he will accelerate upwards, because the 15 kilograms is heavier than its own weight. But if it starts to climb very fast, it could go the other way.(所以猴子正在往上爬。如果猴子什么都不做，它会向上加速，因为15公斤比它自身的重量还要重。但如果它开始快速攀爬，情况就可能相反。)

So if we take T minus mg, that's the total force on the monkey. This, according to Newton's second law, is equal to ma, where a is the acceleration of the monkey upwards. So the acceleration is equal to this.  But we know what T is. Now we do it on the block. On the block, there's a force which is mg.(因此，如果我们用T减去mg，这就是猴子受到的总力。根据牛顿第二定律，这等于ma，其中a是猴子向上的加速度。所以加速度等于这个值。但我们知道T是多少。现在我们来看木块。木块上有一个力，即mg。)

对于猴子：$T-mg=ma_{m}$；对于重物：$T-Mg=-Ma_{M}$

And there is a tension of T. So T minus mg is equal to the acceleration upwards of the big mass. But that's equal to ma minus, because the monkey's acceleration upwards is equal to the block's acceleration downwards, because they are on the same string. So we have these two formulas.(这里有一个张力T。所以T减去mg等于大质量物体向上的加速度。但这等于ma减去，因为猴子向上的加速度等于木块向下的加速度，因为它们在同一根绳子上。所以我们有这两个公式。)

With these two formulas, you have you can solve this problem. For example, what would be the case if a is equal to zero? If there's no acceleration, that means if a is equal to zero, that means T has to equal to mg. If T is equal to mg, if T is equal to what happens if a is equal to zero, then from this formula, T is equal to mg. But T is equal to. I've made a mistake. Just a minute. (有了这两个公式，你就能解决这个问题。例如，如果a等于零会怎样？如果没有加速度，也就是说a等于零，那么T必须等于mg。如果T等于mg，如果a等于零时T等于什么，那么从这个公式来看，T等于mg。但T等于...我犯了个错误。稍等一下。)

Does anybody understand where I've made a mistake? First, this formula. No, the mistake is that the monkey's acceleration is not the string's acceleration. So this is the monkey's acceleration and this is the string's acceleration.(有人知道我哪里出错了吗？首先，这个公式。不，错误在于猴子的加速度不等于绳子的加速度。所以这是猴子的加速度，而这是绳子的加速度。)

当猴子不上不下，$a_{m}=0$，则 $T=mg$

But if the monkey's acceleration is is equal to zero, you notice the monkey doesn't doesn't go upward or downward with any acceleration, then T is equal to mg. And we then get this formula for for how the string moves. The string moves like the like the heavy mass.(但如果猴子的加速度为零，你会注意到猴子不会以任何加速度向上或向下移动，那么T就等于mg。然后我们得到了这个关于绳子如何运动的公式。绳子就像重物一样移动。)

if the acceleration mass is supposed to speak, mass is not moving. Then then T is equal to mg. If T is equal to mg, then capital M G minus small M G is equal to M A M. So in that case, in that case, M minus M G is equal to M A of the monkey.（如果假设重物没有移动。那么T就等于Mg。如果T等于 Mg，那么大MG减去小MG就等于ma_m。所以在这种情况下，Mg减去mg等于猴子的ma_m。）

当重物不动，$a_{M}=0$，则 $T=Mg$，$Mg-mg=ma_{m}$    $a_{m} = \frac{Mg-mg}{m}$

So the monkey's acceleration is equal to M minus M divided by M times G. It was for the monkey to climb such that the big block does not move. The monkey has to be accelerated like this. Let's try the next one.（所以猴子的加速度等于M减M除以M乘以G。这是为了让猴子攀爬时大块不动。猴子必须这样加速。让我们试试下一个。）

The next one is a block, a block moving on a, let me see, a block is moving on a surface without the tension. So on on the block, there are the following forces. This is T, the tension on the rope, and this is M G. The problem is what is if if the acceleration, the block begins to move in this direction.(下一个是一个木块，一个木块在移动，让我看看，一个木块在没有张力的表面上移动。所以在木块上，有以下这些力。这是T，绳子上的张力，这是MG。问题是如果加速度，木块开始朝这个方向移动。)

So X is equal to point one, two meters per second. And the mass is equal to ninety five hundred kilograms. The block does not move.  This angle is equal to eighteen degrees. The block has two forces on it, T and M G. T can be decomposed into a vertical component and a horizontal component. The vertical component of T must balance M G, because if it does not balance M G, that block would either move upwards or move downwards, which it cannot.(所以ax 等于每秒0.12米。质量为9500千克。该方块保持静止状态。这个角度等于 18 度。方块受到两个力的作用：张力T和重力MG。张力T可以分解为垂直分量和水平分量。T的垂直分量必须与重力MG相平衡，因为如果两者不平衡，方块就会向上或向下移动，而这是不可能发生的。)

So so we therefore know T times sine theta, sine eighteen degrees, has equal to equal to M G. So that tells us what T is. And then the acceleration, T cosine eighteen degrees, is the horizontal force. And that horizontal force has to be equal to the mass times the acceleration.(因此，我们知道T乘以sinθ，即sin18度，等于MG。这告诉我们T的值。然后，加速度T乘以cos18度就是水平力。这个水平力必须等于质量乘以加速度。)

So if I take the ratio of these two, I get tangent of eighteen degrees is equal to G over A. Or A is equal to G times cotangent eighteen degrees. Let's try another one. There's a block on a frictionless slope.(所以，如果我将这两者相比，我会得到18度的正切值等于G除以A。或者说，A等于G乘以18度的余切值。让我们再试一个例子。有一个放在无摩擦斜坡上的木块。)

It suffers a force R. When you have two surfaces in contact, if there's no friction, then the force between the two is always a normal force, always perpendicular to the surface. So one force is R, which is perpendicular to this. The other block that suffers a force is M G. In this problem, it says that its acceleration is equal to zero.(它受到一个力R的作用。当两个表面接触时，如果没有摩擦力，那么两者之间的力总是法向力，总是垂直于表面。所以一个力是R，垂直于这个表面。另一个受到力的物体是M G。在这个问题中，它说它的加速度等于零。)

And it tells you that its mass is equal to one hundred kilograms. And then it says there's a third force. The third force is like this. So it says the total acceleration is equal to zero. So the total force is equal to zero. The net force is equal to zero.(它告诉你，它的质量等于一百公斤。然后它说有第三个力。第三个力是这样的。所以它说总加速度等于零。所以总力等于零。净力等于零。)

So R plus M G, plus F has to equal to zero. This angle is given to be thirty degrees. Then, it's most convenient because two forces are along the X and Y direction. So it's best to resolve R into horizontal and vertical components. So R, this is a minus sign. R cosine theta has to be equal to M G. R sine theta has to equal to F. (所以R加上M G，再加上F必须等于零。这个角度已知是三十度。然后，因为有两个力是沿着X和Y方向的，所以最方便的做法是将R分解为水平和垂直分量。因此，R，这里有一个负号。R cosθ必须等于M G。R sinθ必须等于F。)

Because R cosine theta is a force upwards, which balances M G. R sine theta balances F. So if I take the ratio again, I get tangent theta is equal to F over M G. So F is equal to M G times tangent theta. Theta is equal to thirty degrees. There are a lot of exercises in Chapter 5. I recommend that beyond doing the exercises that I assign, you do some other exercises. The more exercises you do, the easier they are.(因为R cosθ是向上的力，与MG平衡。R sinθ与F平衡。所以如果我再取比值，就得到tanθ等于F除以MG。因此F等于MG乘以tanθ。θ等于30度。第五章有很多练习题。我建议除了完成我布置的习题外，你们还应该做一些其他习题。做的习题越多，它们就越容易。)

------------------------

I will talk about Chapter 6. Chapter 6 is mainly about friction. Why is there friction? When you have two surfaces in contact, now each surface consists of many atoms. In fact, many layers of atoms. 一层一层的atom 在一个,比如我的手,我的皮肤, the atoms are not necessarily very regularly arranged. 不一定是很规则的 But in a crystal, it is very regularly arranged. However, in a usual crystal, there is usually a foam.(我将讲解第六章的内容。第六章主要讨论摩擦力。为什么会产生摩擦力呢？当两个表面相互接触时，每个表面都由许多原子组成。实际上，是多层原子构成的。比如我的手，我的皮肤，这些原子并不一定排列得非常规则。但在晶体中，原子排列就非常规则。不过，在普通晶体中，通常会存在泡沫结构。)

There is a surface layer above it. And on that surface layer, it is not necessarily very regular. If you have a very clean crystal surface, if you have another very clean crystal surface of the same type, and cut the same way, if you put the two together, it is very possible that it almost matches.(上面还有一层表面。而在那层表面上，它不一定非常规则。如果你有一个非常干净的晶体表面，如果你有另一个同样类型、同样切割方式的非常干净的晶体表面，当你把两者放在一起时，它们很有可能会几乎完全吻合。)

If that is the case, the friction is extremely large. Because the friction of force between two surfaces is usually the sum of the forces of all the atoms along one surface exerting on the atoms on the other surface. If it is a perfect crystal, then these two forces are extremely large. And that is not what the usual friction is about. That is much, much larger than a usual crystal, than a usual friction. In fact, if you have two of those things together, you cannot separate them.(如果是这样的话，摩擦力会非常大。因为两个表面之间的摩擦力通常是一个表面上所有原子对另一个表面原子施加的力的总和。如果是一个完美的晶体，那么这两个力会非常大。而这并不是通常摩擦力的概念。这比普通晶体、普通摩擦力要大得多得多。事实上，如果你把两个这样的东西放在一起，它们就无法分开。)

It is just... But that is very rare. Because first, you do not have two perfect surfaces. Second, they may not match. So in a usual case, like my hand, it has all kinds of irregularities. And if I take the table, the table also has irregularities. And when I put my hand on the table, there are areas where they exert great force on each other, but there are areas where they are not exerting great force.(这只是...但这种情况非常罕见。首先，你很难找到两个完全平整的表面。其次，它们可能并不匹配。所以在通常情况下，比如我的手，它就有各种不规则的地方。而桌子也是如此，表面也有不平整之处。当我把手放在桌子上时，有些区域会相互施加很大的力，但有些区域则不会。)

And that is the science of friction. It is an extremely messy subject, because it depends on the condition of the surface. In recent years, surface physics has become very important. But one does not study such things like the interaction between my hand and the table. That is a very messy subject. It is...one talks about more accurate surfaces because surface interaction is very important for manufacturing.(这就是摩擦的科学原理。这是一个极其复杂的课题，因为它取决于表面的状态。近年来，表面物理学变得非常重要。但人们不会研究像我的手和桌子之间的相互作用这样的东西。那是一个非常复杂的课题。人们更多地谈论更精确的表面，因为表面相互作用对制造业非常重要。)

You should read page 100 of the book, because it gives you some more detailed discussions about the interaction between two surfaces. So the usual discussion of daily life's friction is a phenomenological description. Phenomenological. Phenomenon means xianxiang. Phenomenological means xianxiang de. So the usual study of friction in daily life is a phenomenological study, and you cannot do very deep studies.(你应该阅读这本书的第100页，因为它提供了关于两个表面之间相互作用的更详细讨论。因此，日常生活中关于摩擦的常见讨论是一种现象学的描述。现象学的。现象指的是现象。现象学的意味着现象的。因此，日常生活中对摩擦的研究是一种现象学研究，你无法进行非常深入的研究。)

So it's mostly empirical. Empirical means jinyan. Jinyan de study. There are some concepts in daily life. One is called static friction force. Static means static. This static friction force is called static. A static friction force is usually like this. This is not a very accurate thing. For example, there is a block here. This block has a normal force against the surface. So this block has a force, n, against the surface.（所以这主要是经验性的。经验性意味着经验。经验的研究。日常生活中有一些概念。一个叫做静摩擦力。静意味着静止。这个静摩擦力被称为静。静摩擦力通常是这样。这不是一个非常精确的东西。例如，这里有一个方块。这个方块对表面有一个法向力。所以这个方块有一个力，n，作用在表面上。）

That's the force on the block by the surface. Of course, according to Newton's third law, the block also exerts a force, minus n, on the surface. So let's first talk about the force on the block. That's equal to n. That part is always there. But there is also a frictional force. Suppose the block wants to move in this direction.（这就是表面作用在木块上的力。当然，根据牛顿第三定律，木块也会对表面施加一个力，即负n。所以，我们先来讨论作用在木块上的力。这个力等于n。这部分总是存在的。但还有一个摩擦力。假设木块想要朝这个方向移动。）

Then the surface exerts a force, F static, against it. For example, if the block is on a slope, there is a gravitational force which makes it slide. But there is a frictional force, F s, which... Suppose there's a block here. There's a gravitational force. Part of the gravitational force is balanced by a reaction this way. But part of the gravitational force exerts a force this way to make it slide.（然后表面会施加一个力，即静摩擦力F static，与之对抗。例如，如果木块位于斜坡上，重力会使其下滑。但存在一个摩擦力F s，它...假设这里有一个木块。它受到重力作用。部分重力被这个方向的反作用力平衡。但另一部分重力会沿这个方向施加力使其滑动。）

Then the friction is F s, which balances that part and makes it not move. So that's called static frictional force. The static frictional force experimentally is equal to a static coefficient times the normal. So in this case, because the block does not suffer, does not have any tendency to move, so this F s is equal to zero. But in this case, this F s is not equal to zero. This F s balances the gravitational force pull downwards.（那么摩擦力就是Fs，它平衡了那一部分力使其不移动。所以这被称为静摩擦力。实验表明，静摩擦力等于静摩擦系数乘以法向力。所以在这种情况下，因为木块没有受到任何移动的趋势，所以这个Fs等于零。但在这种情况下，这个Fs不等于零。这个Fs平衡了向下拉的重力。）

This is if the block does not move, if there's no relative motion between the two. There is a kinetic frictional force. For example, this block, if the block moves either upwards or downwards, then the force, then the frictional force, which is parallel to the surface, is not governed by this.（如果方块没有移动，即两者之间没有相对运动时，存在静摩擦力。例如，当这个方块无论向上还是向下移动时，平行于表面的摩擦力并不受此影响。）

It's governed by a different coefficient. So this is a coefficient of friction for static force. This is a coefficient for friction for a dynamic force, for a kinetic force. Mu s is usually less than mu static. And you have that experience. If you have a block on the surface, suppose I put a heavy block on the surface.（它由不同的系数控制。所以这是静摩擦力的摩擦系数。这是动摩擦力的摩擦系数。μs通常小于静摩擦系数μ。你有这样的经验。如果你把一个重物放在表面上，假设我在表面上放一个重物。）

If I try to push it, if I push it very gently, it doesn't move. Why? Because there's a opposing frictional force exerted by the surface on the block, which balances my push. But if I push very hard, it will begin to move.（如果我试着推它，轻轻地推，它不动。为什么？因为表面施加在物体上的摩擦力与我的推力相平衡。但如果我用力推，它就会开始移动。）

Why? Because when the frictional force is larger, the force that I push is larger than this frictional force. This static frictional force has an N. N is the weight of the block. If I push too hard and exceed this number, then it will begin to move.（为什么？因为当摩擦力增大时，我施加的推力也会超过这个摩擦力。这个静摩擦力有一个N值，N代表木块的重量。如果我推得太用力，超过了这个数值，木块就会开始移动。）

After it begins to move, it obeys this formula. But this formula, the mu k, is usually smaller than mu s. As a consequence, once it starts to move, the frictional force becomes suddenly less. This, in fact, you have the experience. If there's a very heavy object here, you can push very hard. But once it starts to move, it suddenly becomes easier. Read page 101.（一旦开始移动，它就会遵循这个公式。但这个公式中的μk通常比μs小。因此，一旦开始移动，摩擦力会突然减小。实际上，你也有这样的经验。如果这里有一个非常重的物体，你可以用力推它。但一旦它开始移动，突然就会变得更容易。请阅读第101页。）

Let's do sample problem 6-1. This is on page 101. It talks about a particle which has an original velocity on a frictional surface. So it becomes slower and slower until eventually it stops. V final is equal to zero. The coefficient of kinetic friction is given to be 0.6. And the distance is 290 meters.(让我们来做例题6-1。这道题在101页上。题目讲的是一个粒子在摩擦表面上具有初速度。所以它会越来越慢，直到最终停止。最终速度V等于零。题目给出的动摩擦系数是0.6。距离是290米。)

The question is, what is the original velocity? For a physics problem, the way to do it, the easiest way, is you first collect a few formulas without putting numbers into it. So we know v zero. Suppose the time interval between here and here is t. Then there's an acceleration, so v zero is equal to a t. And the distance is equal to one half a t squared.(问题是，初速度是多少？对于物理问题来说，最简单的方法是先收集几个公式，不代入具体数字。我们知道初速度v₀。假设这里到这里的时间间隔是t。然后有一个加速度，所以v₀等于a乘以t。而距离等于二分之一a乘以t的平方。)

And we also know the force on it is equal to m a. And m a is equal to m times the normal force. The force is equal to m g times mu k. This is a kinetic case. So, we have three formulas. Out of these three formulas, we get, for example, g is equal to mu k g is equal to a, and t is equal to square root of 2x over a. So, it's equal to square root of 2x over mu k g. V zero is equal to a times t is equal to m g, m k g times t. So, as I told you last time, it's best to first not put numbers in.(我们还知道作用在它上面的力等于 m a。而 m a 等于 m 乘以法向力。这个力等于 m g 乘以 μk。这是一个动力学情况。因此，我们得到了三个公式。从这三个公式中，我们可以得出，例如，g 等于 μk g 等于 a，而 t 等于 2x 除以 a 的平方根。因此，它等于 2x 除以 μk g 的平方根。V₀ 等于 a 乘以 t，等于 m g，μk g 乘以 t。正如我上次告诉你们的，最好不要一开始就代入数字。)

Just collect the formulas, and after you get eventually a formula where the right-hand side all consists of known quantities, at that point you put in the numbers and first check that the dimension is correct, then do the computation. Now, another topic is called drag force. Read the chapter. (只需收集公式，当你最终得到一个右边全由已知量组成的公式时，就可以代入数值，先检查量纲是否正确，再进行计算。现在，另一个主题叫做阻力。阅读这一章。)

Read section 6-3. Drag force means if an object moving, for example, in air, a body moving in a liquid or in gas, then there's a frictional force on it, and that's called drag force. That's an extremely complicated subject.  It's related to what is called hydrodynamics. Laterally. Laterally is an extremely important subject, because if you want to design a good car, you have to deal with the friction.(阅读第6-3节。阻力指的是当一个物体在空气、液体或气体中移动时，作用在其上的摩擦力，这种力被称为阻力。这是一个极其复杂的课题，与所谓的流体力学有关。流体力学是一个极其重要的课题，因为如果你想设计一辆好车，就必须处理好这种摩擦力。)

If you want to design a submarine, you have to deal with friction. And this is a complicated subject, which is half theoretical, half experimental. Actually, the fundamental equations of hydrodynamics, at least for liquid, was already studied in the 18th and 19th century because of practical use.（如果你想设计一艘潜艇，就必须解决摩擦问题。这是一个复杂的课题，一半是理论性的，一半是实验性的。事实上，流体力学的基本方程，至少对于液体而言，早在 18 和 19 世纪就因实际应用而被研究过了。）

But there are improvements of the theory and of the experiment, and it is a very important subject. And it is important both from the theoretical viewpoint and from the application viewpoint. Now, there are some somewhat tricky problems in the book. Let's do chapter 6, 27p. It talks about a block resting on a slab. So this is a small block with a mass of 10 kilograms.（但该理论和实验仍有改进空间，这是一个非常重要的课题。无论从理论角度还是应用角度来看，它都具有重要意义。这本书中存在一些较为棘手的问题。让我们来看第六章第27页的内容，其中讨论了一个放置在平板上的物块。这是一个质量为10公斤的小物块。）

This is a big slab with a weight, with a mass of 40 kilograms. You can think of, imagine there's a surface. This surface is frictionless, no friction. And it's given that the static coefficient of friction is 0.6. The kinetic friction is 0.4. And the block, the small mass, is given a big force of 100 newtons. The question is what happens to the block and to the slab. Now you have to think. （这是一块带有重量的厚板，质量为40公斤。你可以设想、想象有一个表面。这个表面是无摩擦的，没有摩擦力。已知静摩擦系数为0.6，动摩擦系数为0.4。给这个小质量的物块施加了一个100牛顿的大力。问题是物块和厚板会发生什么情况。现在你得思考一下。）

It's like there's ice underneath, and there's a big block on top. On top of the big block, there's a small block. All these coefficients are between the big block and the slab. Between the slab and the small block, there's no friction on the bottom surface. It's like on ice. Okay, imagine, suppose you have such a thing.（就像下面有冰，上面有一个大块。在大块上面，还有一个小块。所有这些系数都在大块和平板之间。在平板和小块之间，底部表面没有摩擦。就像在冰上一样。好吧，想象一下，假设你有这样一个东西。）

You have a heavy object on the ice, and you put a smaller object on top of it. Now you give the small object a big push, 100 kilograms, or 100 newtons. So let us first assume there are two possibilities.(冰面上有一个重物，你在上面放了一个较小的物体。现在你对这个小物体施加一个很大的推力，100公斤或100牛顿。那么让我们首先假设存在两种可能性。)

One is that the slab, the block and the slab would move together, would slide together on the ice, without relative motion between the two. The other one is that the block or the small mass would move, and you can imagine that the slab would move, but the slab wouldn't move without the big block on top. The big block on top would move with the small block on the bottom.(一种情况是，板块、大块体和板块会一起移动，在冰面上一起滑动，两者之间没有相对运动。另一种情况是，小块体或小质量物体会移动，你可以想象板块会移动，但如果没有顶部的大块体，板块就不会移动。顶部的大块体会与底部的小块体一起移动。)

What exactly is this? Let's try it out. So let's assume no relative motion between small and big masses. Between the block and the slab. In that case, you think of the two as together. So its total mass is 50 kilograms. What is the force on the total force? When you say total force, you mean external force.(这到底是什么？我们来试试看。假设小质量和大质量之间没有相对运动，也就是滑块和平板之间没有相对运动。在这种情况下，你可以把两者看作一个整体。那么它的总质量是50公斤。作用在这个整体上的总力是多少？当你说总力时，指的是外力。)

Total external force on the two. There are two. One is the force by the surface on it, which has to be 50 kilograms in order to balance the gravitational force. If it doesn't balance, the two would fly up and down, of course. That's ridiculous. But there is also a... There's no horizontal component because there's no friction.(作用在两人身上的总外力。有两个。一个是表面施加的力，必须是50公斤才能平衡重力。如果不平衡，两人当然会上下飞动。这太荒谬了。但还有一个...没有水平分量，因为没有摩擦力。)

So the only force is 100 kilograms, 100 newton. So the 100 newton is equal to the total mass times acceleration. The total mass is 50 kilograms times acceleration. So therefore we know the acceleration is two meters per second squared. In other words, if the two move together, then we know the acceleration. The acceleration is two units, two meters per second squared.(所以唯一的力是100公斤，即100牛顿。因此，100牛顿等于总质量乘以加速度。总质量是50公斤乘以加速度。因此，我们知道加速度是每秒两米的平方。换句话说，如果两者一起移动，那么我们就知道加速度。加速度是两个单位，即每秒两米的平方。)

Now we consider the force on the block, on the small mass. So the small mass now moves with an acceleration of two units. So now we consider force on the small block, on the block. It has one force, which is 100 newtons. It has another force, which is the friction. If the two move together, that does not mean that there's no force between them.(现在我们考虑作用在小质量块上的力。这个小质量块现在以两个单位的加速度运动。因此，我们现在考虑作用在小木块上的力。它受到一个力，即100牛顿。它还受到另一个力，即摩擦力。如果两者一起运动，并不意味着它们之间没有力的作用。)

There's a force between them, and we know the acceleration. So therefore, this force on the block has equal to 10 kilograms times acceleration, times two. But the force on the block is equal to 100 newtons minus the frictional force. Therefore, we can calculate the frictional force. This is therefore equal to 20 newtons. So therefore the force is equal to 80 newtons.(它们之间存在一个力，而且我们知道加速度。因此，作用在木块上的这个力等于10公斤乘以加速度，再乘以2。但作用在木块上的力等于100牛顿减去摩擦力。因此，我们可以计算出摩擦力。这样算出来等于20牛顿。所以这个力等于80牛顿。)

---------------

这个题目是说，一个大物块 40kg，与光滑地面之间无摩擦，大物块上还有一个 10kg 的小物块，大小物块之间，静摩擦系数为 0.6，动摩擦系数为 0.4，现在在小物块上施加一个 100N 的力，问它们是怎么个运动状态？

先假设这两个物块一起动，即大小物块之间没有相对运动，那么整体水平方向上只有 100N 的力，总质量 50kg，则加速度 a = 2 m/s$^2$，如此再针对小物块，加速度为 2 m/s$^2$，推力为 100N，那么摩擦力大小应该是 80N，但实际上大小物块之间静摩擦力系数 0.6，因此摩擦力最大是 60N，所以这不可能，即小物块必然相对大物块有运动。

运动起来以后，大小物块之间摩擦力为 40 N，那么对于小物块合力为 60N，加速度是 6 m/s$^2$；而对于大物块，水平方向上只有 40N 的摩擦力，加速度为 1 m/s$^2$，所以两个物块都往前走，但大物块加速度小。

-----------

That cannot be, because the normal force between the block and the slab is the weight, which is 10 kilograms. That 10 kilograms multiplied by static, by 0.6, is only 6 newtons. Pardon? So therefore it's not possible. So what we have done is we analyzed, could it be that the two move together? The answer is not possible. It's not possible because that requires too large a force, frictional force between the two. Therefore, there is relative motion between the two blocks, between the two masses.(这不可能，因为木块与木板之间的法向力就是其重量，即10公斤。10公斤乘以静摩擦系数0.6，只有6牛顿。什么？所以这是不可能的。因此我们分析过，两者是否会一起移动？答案是不可能。不可能是因为这需要两者之间有太大的摩擦力。因此，这两个木块之间、这两个质量之间存在相对运动。)

Once you know that there is relative motion, you know the friction. So the friction, F between the two, is equal to what? It's equal to its mass, the mass of the smaller block, which is 10 kilograms. Multiply it by mu kinetic, so it's equal to 10 kilograms multiplied by 0.4, which is 4 newtons. Pardon? I don't understand. You are against my saying that the frictional force is equal to 4 newtons. I didn't get your point.(一旦你知道存在相对运动，就能确定摩擦力。那么两者之间的摩擦力F等于什么呢？它等于质量——即较小物块的质量10千克——乘以动摩擦系数μk。因此，计算结果为10千克乘以0.4，等于4牛顿。什么？我没听明白。你不同意我说摩擦力等于4牛顿的观点。我没理解你的意思。)

The frictional force... You are saying 40, there is a G, gravity acceleration, Mg. Oh, sorry. Sorry. 10 kilograms multiplied by G, multiplied by 0.4, whatever the value is. It's about 40 newtons. But I think I made a mistake just now. Let's go back. Wait a minute. 100 newtons is equal to 50, and A is equal to 2 meters.(摩擦力……你说40，有个G，重力加速度，Mg。哦，抱歉。抱歉。10公斤乘以G，乘以0.4，不管数值是多少。大约是40牛顿。但我觉得刚才我搞错了。我们倒回去。等一下。100牛顿等于50，A等于2米。)

It's about 40 newtons. If we know this, let's say it's 40 newtons. If the friction, the force between the two, we know it's 40 newtons, then let's analyze the small mass. The acceleration of the small mass is equal to 100 newtons minus 40 newtons, divided by 10 kilograms. This is 6 meters per second. I should have drawn it like this.(大约是40牛顿。如果我们知道这个，假设是40牛顿。如果摩擦力，即两者之间的力，我们知道是40牛顿，那么我们来分析小质量物体。小质量物体的加速度等于100牛顿减去40牛顿，再除以10千克。这就是6米每秒。我应该这样画的。)

And the acceleration of the big mass, the force on the big mass is 40 newtons, 40 newtons divided by 40 kilograms, which is equal to 1 meter per second. What that means is that if you give the small block a very large force, it would begin to slide on the big mass. But when it slides, it exerts a force on the big mass, and therefore the big mass also moves, but at a slower acceleration than the small mass.(大质量的加速度，即作用在大质量上的力为40牛顿，40牛顿除以40公斤，等于1米每秒。这意味着如果你对小木块施加一个很大的力，它就会开始在大质量上滑动。但当它滑动时，会对大质量施加一个力，因此大质量也会移动，但其加速度比小质量慢。)

-------------

如果把施加的力改为 10N，小于静摩擦力 60N，作为两个物块之间不会滑动，作为整体它们有加速度 0.2m/s$^2$；

-----------

If, however, we use only 10 newtons on the small block, what happens? Let's go back to the A equation. Assume no relative motion between the two masses. What is the acceleration at that time? It's 10 newtons divided by 50 kilograms. So it's just 0.2 meters per second squared. 0.2 meters per second squared. Now let's calculate the reaction between the two.(然而，如果我们只对小木块施加10牛顿的力，会发生什么？让我们回到A方程。假设两个质量之间没有相对运动。此时的加速度是多少？是10牛顿除以50千克。所以只有0.2米每二次方秒。0.2米每二次方秒。现在让我们计算两者之间的反作用力。)

The force, that's the friction force, is equal to 10 newtons. The friction force between the two blocks is equal to 10 kilograms times the acceleration, which is equal to 2 meters per second. 2 newtons. So the force is equal to 8 newtons. No relative motion. Okay.(这个力，也就是摩擦力，等于10牛顿。两个方块之间的摩擦力等于10千克乘以加速度，即.2米每秒。2牛顿。因此，这个力等于8牛顿。没有相对运动。好的。)

I looked at Chapter 6. Chapter 6 is a very complicated chapter because friction and hydrodynamics are very difficult subjects. But for freshman physics, we don't go into the details. So we go to the next chapter, Chapter 7. Chapter 7 discusses energy. Now this is an extremely important subject. What we are going to discuss, there is kinetic energy. In Chinese, it's called dynamic energy.(我看了第六章。第六章是一个非常复杂的章节，因为摩擦力和流体力学是非常难的主题。但对于大一物理课程，我们不会深入细节。所以我们继续下一章，第七章。第七章讨论的是能量。这是一个极其重要的主题。我们将要讨论的内容包括动能。在中文里，它被称为"动能"。)

There is static energy. Okay. These two were understood already around Newton's time, although it may not have been called so. Obviously, it's clear that Newton and people like Laplace, Lagrange, all knew about these kind of energies. But then, of course, people knew that there are other energies. There is electromagnetic energy.(有静电能。好的。这两种能量在牛顿时代就已经被理解了，尽管当时可能没有这样的称呼。显然，牛顿以及拉普拉斯、拉格朗日等人都知道这类能量。但当然，人们也知道还有其他形式的能量存在。比如电磁能。)

There is chemical energy. For example, there is fire. And the energy involved in fire is a chemical energy. But actually, of course, all chemical energy are electromagnetic. When you understand chemical reactions, you know they are all due to electromagnetic energy. But anyway, all these energies were successively studied and understood.(存在化学能。例如，火就是化学能的一种表现形式。而火所涉及的能量就是化学能。但实际上，所有的化学能本质上都属于电磁能。当你理解了化学反应，就会明白它们都是由电磁能驱动的。但无论如何，所有这些能量形式都相继被研究和理解。)

And finally, in the mid-19th century, there was the concept of conservation of energy. And that's also called the first law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics, perhaps it was a complicated story, but perhaps the person who made the greatest contribution of this was Lord Kelvin. The conservation of energy, or the first law of thermodynamics, is one of the fundamental laws of physics. We'll have many, many discussions of it.(最终，在19世纪中叶，能量守恒的概念被提出。这也被称为热力学第一定律。热力学第一定律。热力学第一定律，或许这是一个复杂的故事，但或许对此贡献最大的人是开尔文勋爵。能量守恒，或者说热力学第一定律，是物理学的基本定律之一。我们将对此进行许多许多的讨论。)

But in the first two chapters of chapters 7 and 8, we are talking about the kinetic energy and the static energy, which were the earliest known concepts of energy. We shall prove later that the kinetic energy, that if a body moves with a certain velocity, it has a certain energy. And that energy, you might say, let's first define it as a kinetic energy.(但在第7章和第8章的前两节中，我们讨论的是动能和静能，这是人类最早认知的能量形式。稍后我们将证明，当一个物体以特定速度运动时，它就具有某种能量。这种能量——我们可以先将其定义为动能。)

Why we define it, we shall come to later. And it's equal to one-half of mv squared. v squared, of course, is equal to... When you write this, that means v dot v. It's a scalar product. And, of course, because of the definition, we defined v dot v as the product of the two lengths times the cosine of the angle between the two. But the angle is zero, so this is equal to v squared. This is the definition of kinetic energy.(我们稍后会解释为什么这样定义。它等于二分之一乘以mv的平方。当然，v的平方等于...当你这样写时，意味着v点乘v。这是一个标量积。当然，根据定义，我们将v点乘v定义为两个长度的乘积乘以它们之间夹角的余弦值。但夹角为零，所以这等于v的平方。这就是动能的定义。)

动能：$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2$

焦耳 $1\,\text{J} = 1\,(\text{kg})(\text{m/s})^2=1\,(\text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^2)(\text{m})=1\,\text{N}\cdot \text{m}$

And its unit is one joule. One joule is equal to one times kilogram times velocity squared, which is m. But you can easily show that this is equal to Newton times meter, because Newton is kilogram. Newton is equal to kilogram times m divided by s squared. So if you multiply this by a meter, you get this. So Newton meter is equivalent to kilogram m over s squared, and it's called a joule. Okay, next we are going to show why this is important.(其单位是焦耳。1焦耳等于1千克乘以速度的平方。但你可以轻松证明这等同于牛顿乘以米，因为牛顿等于千克。牛顿等于千克乘以米除以秒的平方。因此，若将此乘以米，便得到此结果。所以牛顿米等同于千克米每二次方秒，这就是所谓的焦耳。好了，接下来我们将展示为何这一点至关重要。)

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left( \frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2 \right)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left( \frac{1}{2}m \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} \right)=\frac{1}{2}m \vec{v} \cdot \dot{\vec{v}}+\frac{1}{2}m \dot{\vec{v}} \cdot \vec{v}=m \dot{\vec{v}} \cdot \vec{v}=\vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}= \vec{F} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

We have the formula. The easiest way to show this is let us take the time derivative of the kinetic energy. That is equal to d dt of one half of m v dot v. 根據我上回曾經講過,一個 derivative of the product of two things is equal to, the derivative of alpha beta is equal to, alpha beta dot is equal to alpha dot beta plus alpha beta dot. And that is true also for scalar product, because a scalar product can be written as a sum of the x component multiplied plus the y component multiplied plus the z component multiplied. So you apply it to each of those three terms.(我们有这个公式。最简单的方法是让我们对动能求时间导数。这等于d/dt（1/2 m v·v）。根据我之前讲过的，两个量的乘积的导数等于，αβ的导数等于，αβ点等于α点β加上αβ点。这也适用于标量积，因为标量积可以写成x分量相乘加上y分量相乘加上z分量相乘的和。所以你可以将其应用于这三个项中的每一项。)

You get the... So therefore, this means that this is equal to one half of m of v dot v dot plus one half of m v dot dot v. But scalar product is commutative, so therefore these two terms are the same. So therefore you get m v dot, which is equal to... m v dot is equal to acceleration, which is equal to... which is equal to the force, according to Newton's second law. R is equal to force dot dx dt.(你得到的是……因此，这意味着这等于二分之一m乘以v点乘v点，再加上二分之一m乘以v点点乘v。但标量积是可交换的，因此这两项是相同的。因此，你得到m乘以v点，等于……m乘以v点等于加速度，而根据牛顿第二定律，加速度等于……等于力。R等于力点乘dx dt。)

If you see that both sides have dt, so if I multiply by dt and integrate, I get the integrate of d. All I did is I multiplied the dt by both sides. And integration merely means you add together. The integration is equal to sum. The integration is actually equal to sum. Only what you are summing is very small parts. You make a continuous thing.(如果你看到两边都有dt，那么如果我乘以dt并积分，就得到d的积分。我所做的只是将dt乘以两边。积分仅仅意味着你把东西加在一起。积分等于求和。积分实际上等于求和。只不过你所求和的是非常小的部分。你让一个连续的东西变得离散。)

So this is... what is in here is a continuous thing. You write a small d. That means this kinetic energy keeps on increasing, for example. And you put the increase into many small parts and then add them together. But that, of course, is nothing but the original... the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy. Let me repeat. What I said is a fundamental thing.(所以这就是...这里面是一个连续的过程。你写一个小d，比如这意味着动能持续增加。你把增量分成许多小部分，然后把它们加起来。但这当然只不过是原来的...最终动能减去初始动能。让我重复一遍。我所说的是一件根本性的事情。)

Namely, the integral d is nothing but the sum. What is meant by a sum of many d's? Many d's means you have an increase in kinetic energy. You divide that kinetic energy into a million small steps, and you take each small increase and add them together.(也就是说，积分d只不过是求和。多个d的和是什么意思呢？多个d意味着动能增加。你将动能分成数百万个小步骤，然后取每个小的增量并将它们相加。)

But if you would take each small increase and add them together, of course, the final result is equal to the total difference, so therefore you get this. Now, the last few sentences is the spirit of differential calculus and integral calculus. And that was a revolution. That's a revolution launched by Newton and Leibniz. And unfortunately, in China, that revolution was never launched and never understood. It's the most fundamental and yet the simplest concept once you understand it.(但如果你把每一个微小的增量相加，最终结果自然等于总差值，因此你得到了这个。最后的这几句话，正是微分学和积分学的精髓所在。那是一场革命，一场由牛顿和莱布尼茨发起的革命。遗憾的是，在中国，这场革命从未发生，也从未被理解。一旦你理解了它，就会发现这是最基础却又最简单的概念。)

But for ancient people to realize it, it took a long time. What I want you to do is you deeply appreciate this point, and you can manipulate without thinking. So the steps here, this notation of dx dt as the derivative was due to Leibniz, and it's very important because once you learn how to use it, you don't have to think.(但对于古人来说，认识到这一点花了很长时间。我希望你们能深刻理解这一点，并能不假思索地运用。这里的步骤，这种用dx/dt表示导数的符号是由莱布尼茨提出的，这一点非常重要，因为一旦你学会了如何使用它，就不需要再费心思考了。)

So what I did is I just multiplied dt by both sides as if dt is a number. dt is not a number. It is a number and yet not a number because it's an infinitesimal quantity. And the subtlety of differential and integral calculus is to learn how to use this infinitesimal concept. And once you have learned to use it, once you have learned the notation, you can deal with it as if it's just a number. So I multiply both by dx, and I get this, and I get this.(所以我所做的就是把dt两边都乘以dt，就好像dt是一个数字一样。dt不是一个数字。它既是数字又不是数字，因为它是一个无穷小的量。微积分的精妙之处就在于学会如何运用这个无穷小的概念。一旦你学会了如何使用它，一旦你掌握了这个符号，你就可以像对待普通数字一样处理它。于是我把两边都乘以dx，得到了这个，又得到了这个。)

根据上式：
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left( \frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2 \right)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left( \frac{1}{2}m \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} \right)=\frac{1}{2}m \vec{v} \cdot \dot{\vec{v}}+\frac{1}{2}m \dot{\vec{v}} \cdot \vec{v}=m \dot{\vec{v}} \cdot \vec{v}=\vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}= \vec{F} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t}$$
两边同乘 $\mathrm{d}t$，并取积分：$$\int \mathrm{d}\left( \frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2 \right)=\int \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}x$$
即：$$\left(\frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2\right)_{f} - \left(\frac{1}{2}m \vec{v}^2\right)_{i} = \int \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}x$$
而 $\vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}x$ 称为做功。

So this is equal to... So this expression says if we define kinetic energy as one half of mv squared, then the increase of the kinetic energy so defined is equal to the sum of f dot dx. Now f dot dx means you divide that motion into many little intervals, like a million intervals. In each small interval, you calculate the dx.(所以这等于... 这个表达式说明，如果我们把动能定义为二分之一mv平方，那么这样定义的动能增量就等于f点乘dx的总和。这里的f点乘dx意味着你把运动过程分割成无数小段，比如分成一百万个小段。在每一个微小区间内，你都要计算dx。)

That's the displacement. Multiply it by the force at that time. That's what is the meaning of this. And that is called work. f dot dx is called the work. It's an infinitesimal work because we are only talking about a small distance.(这就是位移。乘以当时的力。这就是它的含义。而这被称为功。f点dx被称为功。这是一个微小的功，因为我们只讨论了一个很小的距离。)

So it's this total infinitesimal work. Therefore, the physical concept really is when a force moves a body, then that force does some work on that body. And that work is equal to the force times the distance. And you cumulate all those works, you get the total work. And that total work is equal to the increase of the kinetic energy. And that is the reason why this formula is important.（所以这就是所有这些微小的功的总和。因此，物理概念实际上是当一个力移动一个物体时，那个力就对物体做了一些功。这个功等于力乘以距离。你把所有这些功累积起来，就得到了总功。而这个总功等于动能的增加。这就是为什么这个公式很重要。）

And that is the beginning of the concept of energy. Here we only talk about the kinetic energy. The book calls this the work kinetic energy theorem. The book spent several pages discussing it because it did not use calculus. You see that using calculus is extremely simple. So all of you must learn calculus as soon as possible.（这就是能量概念的起源。这里我们只讨论动能。书中称之为动能定理。由于没有使用微积分，书中用了好几页来讨论这个问题。你看，用微积分就非常简单了。所以你们所有人都必须尽快学习微积分。）

Once you have learned calculus, it's much easier to understand physics. Now, we were talking about the increase of kinetic energy. But that's not to say the particle could be decelerated. A particle could be moving, and I'm trying to oppose it. So it gradually slows down. In that case, it's a decrease of kinetic energy.（一旦你学会了微积分，理解物理就会容易得多。刚才我们讨论的是动能的增加。但这并不意味着粒子一定会减速。一个粒子可能在运动，而我试图阻止它，于是它逐渐减速。在这种情况下，动能是减少的。）

So the left side would become negative. But it is still equal to this because the force in that case is negative. So I'm doing negative work on it. So we have the concept of negative work. When you talk about the work on something, it's always the force experienced by the object. That's the force.  Very important. F in the box equation. What is F? F is equal to force on the object.（因此，左侧会变为负值。但它仍然等于这个值，因为在这种情况下力是负的。所以我是在对它做负功。于是我们有了负功的概念。当你谈论对某物做功时，它总是物体所受到的力。这就是力。非常重要。方框方程中的F是什么？F等于作用在物体上的力。）

So if a particle is moving fast toward me and I oppose it, the force on the body is a negative. So it's a negative work on it. This on is very important. Because Newton's third law always comes in pairs. And you have to remember this word on. By the way, what I just said is three-dimensional. Notice the box equation is a three-dimensional equation. In other words, suppose a body is moving toward me. If I try to oppose it, I may also try to move it sideways.（所以，如果一个粒子快速向我移动而我试图阻止它，那么作用在物体上的力就是负的。也就是说，对它做的是负功。这里的“作用在”非常重要。因为牛顿第三定律总是成对出现的。你必须记住“作用在”这个词。顺便说一下，我刚才说的是三维的情况。注意这个盒子方程是一个三维方程。换句话说，假设一个物体向我移动。如果我试图阻止它，我也可能试图让它向侧面移动。）

But that sideways force, that part of the force experienced by the body, it has an F, which is perpendicular to the displacement. So that force does not do work. All I'm saying is that remember that this formula, as explicitly written, is a three-dimensional formula. You take the F and talk into dx. Okay. Anybody with any questions about the kinetic energy? I think we better talk about the potential energy next time.（但那个侧向力，即物体所受力的一部分，有一个F，它与位移垂直。所以那个力不做功。我只是想说，记住这个公式，明确写出来的是一个三维公式。你把F和dx结合起来看。好了。关于动能还有什么问题吗？我想我们下次最好讨论一下势能。）

Otherwise, we'll be going much too fast. So I have no more prepared material to tell you today. By the way, I was told that for the holidays, we are going to miss two lectures. But one of them will be replaced by a lecture on the 9th. It's on a Saturday. However, that day I have already another engagement. So I'll ask Professor Wang or Professor An to meet with you on the morning of Saturday, October the 9th. Okay. Goodbye. And have a good Mid-Autumn Festival.  （否则，我们的进度就会太快了。所以今天我准备的内容就到这里。顺便说一下，我听说假期期间我们将错过两节课。但其中一节会在9号补上，那天是周六。不过那天我已经有其他安排了。所以我将请王教授或安教授在10月9日周六上午来给大家上课。好的，再见。祝您中秋节快乐。）
