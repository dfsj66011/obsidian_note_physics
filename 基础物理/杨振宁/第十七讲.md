So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here. There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom. The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface. The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. （那么今天我们先来讨论静压力。假设我们有一个装有某种液体的容器，这里我们考虑一个液柱，上表面的压力为P0，下表面的压力为P。侧面也存在压力。对于液体而言，压力总是垂直于表面的。因此如果我们只考虑垂直方向的力，有P0、重力以及来自底部的压力。重力等于总重量。如果面积为1个单位面积，或者说面积为A，那么P0A就是作用在顶面的总力。PA则是作用在底面的总力。这个液柱的高度为H，因此体积为H乘以A。）

The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation. So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top. Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere. （体积乘以密度等于质量。再乘以重力加速度g就是重量，也就是总力。由于这是静态情况，所以必须保持平衡。因此，我们得出P等于P0加上ρHg，这就是方程15-8。由此可知，深度H处的压强等于顶部压强（通常为1个大气压）加上ρgH。所以在游泳池里，池底的压强远大于水面压强。有人知道在什么深度压强会达到2个大气压吗？大约是10米。对于水来说，密度等于1克/立方厘米，代入计算后约为10米。因此，在水下10米处，压强会增加1个大气压。）

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance. You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil. So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.（现在，我们画的是一个矩形排列。但假设它是这样的，假设水是这样流动的。那么当我们讨论这里的压力时，压力会增加ρGH，这里的H指的是垂直距离。记住，H始终是垂直距离，而不是斜向距离。大家都明白了吗？现在，我们来看问题15-3。如果你有一个U形管，一边是水，另一边是油，这部分是油。那么，我们可能会问，这两边的液面高度差是多少？要找到这个差值，首先，如果我这样做，这两点的压力是相同的。你可以应用这个公式。这个点的压力和这个点的压力，P0相互抵消。）

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1. But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2. Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever.（ρGH相同。因此，这一点的压力与这一点的压力相同。但由于这一点是水，所以这一点的压力，我们称之为B点，等于大气压加上水的密度ρ乘以重力加速度g再乘以距离H1。而B点的压力等于C点的压力。C点的压力等于大气压P0加上油的密度ρ乘以g乘以H2，这里的距离是H2。H2是油的高度。由于这两者相等，我们得到水的密度ρW乘以H1等于油的密度ρoil乘以H2。由于水的密度ρW大于油的密度ρoil，这意味着H1小于H2。这正是帕斯卡原理所描述的，也是液压杠杆的工作原理。）

A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath. If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area. And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. （液压杠杆是一种非常常见的装置。这里有一个小管子，这边有一个大面积的区域，下面全是液体。如果这两部分高度相同，压力也相同。因此，如果我在这里施加一个压力P，那么这里的压力也是相同的。但如果这里的面积是A，这里的面积是A'，那么这里的总重量，这个重量，或者说这个重量就是PA'G。如果A'非常大，这里的总压力就是PAG，这个比例等于A'除以A。抱歉，没有G。因为两个压力相同，所以力与面积成正比。如果这个面积非常大，你就有一个非常大的力。这就是液压制动器都遵循的原理。）


You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight. But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance. So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy. But what you can magnify is the force. （你有一个小管子，对它施加压力，它就能承受很大的重量。当然，如果你对它做功，比如你把它压下一英寸，如果这个面积很大，位移就会很小。因此，你可以获得更大的力，但需要按压更长的距离。如果你想做功，就必须按压很长的距离，而另一侧只上升很小的距离。所以你不会在功上获得增益，但可以在力上获得增益。大家都明白了吗？因此，液压并不能放大功。由于能量守恒，功是无法放大的。但你可以放大的是力。）


Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this. I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng. So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.（接下来我们谈谈阿基米德原理。请阅读这段内容。我相信大家在高中都学过这个知识点。稳态流动也被称为层流。层流就是一层一层地流动。假设你有一根管子，像一根水管，如果在侧面施加压力，水就会在管内流动，但靠近管壁的水流速度为零，因为存在摩擦力。与管壁的接触会使水流减速，而管子中心的水流速度最快。如果绘制速度分布图，这是管子，你会得到这样的速度分布：中心的水流速度最快，边缘的水流速度最慢。因此你可以把水流想象成由许多层组成。）

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent. So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this. If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. （每一层都是一个管状结构，中心管道的流速最快。这就是典型的层流。然而，如果施加更大的压力，流速会越来越快，当达到某一速度时，就会变成湍流。因此可以从层流转变为湍流。这是一个非常复杂的课题，但也是一个极其重要的课题，因为它有巨大的应用价值。这不仅对自来水公司很重要，自来水公司必须注意这一点。如果施加的压力过大，就会变成湍流。你知道湍流是什么样子的。实际上，当水从水龙头流出时，如果流速过快，就会变成湍流。它会变得混乱。）


Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem. He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. （一个著名的问题：在何种压力差或中心速度下，流动会从层流转变为湍流。这是一个著名的问题，至今仍在研究中。但该中心的林教授（C.C. Lin）是这一领域的早期重要贡献者之一。事情是这样的：在20世纪20年代，著名的海森堡——量子力学的开创者之一——在他的博士论文中写到了这个问题。他是德国索末菲的学生。他们都是德国人，而海森堡并没有写一篇关于量子力学的论文。）

He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work. Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. （他写了一篇关于湍流的论文，并获得了博士学位，随后成为量子力学的伟大奠基人之一。但他的博士论文中关于层流转变为湍流的理论是否正确曾引发争议。大约20年后，当时的研究生林家翘撰写的论文澄清了这一问题，并在某种程度上很大程度上支持了海森堡的工作。海森堡和林家翘的研究在当时都非常重要。后来，林家翘成为麻省理工学院的杰出教授，现在他是清华大学某中心的教授。湍流研究之所以特别重要，是因为航空工业的需要。）

When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube.So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow, Incompressible flow, incompressible is not compressible. (当飞机高速飞行时，机翼附近会产生湍流。这种湍流会形成能量阻力，因为湍流会消耗能量。因此，为了节省燃料，必须理解湍流理论。这是一个非常重要的课题，在空气动力学系，湍流是最重要的课题之一。连续性方程。假设有一根管子，可以是大管子中的小管子。我画的是流线。可能在一个非常大的管子里。如果这个面积是A，这个面积是A'，我们讨论的是不可压缩流动。不可压缩流动就是无法被压缩的流动。)

In other words, the density cannot be changed. For example, air is a compressible flow.Because if you add pressure to the air, it becomes denser. But water is essentially incompressible. If you add a lot of pressure, the density of the water will have a small change.So, mostly talking about the water, it's an incompressible flow. Now let's talk about the incompressible flow. If this is A, and this velocity is v, and this velocity is v'.Now, very clearly, A times v times delta t, in a time delta t, you would have a distance of v delta t times an area. So you get that this is the total volume of liquid that enters this area. And that must be equal to the amount which goes out, because you cannot compress it.(换句话说，密度是不可改变的。例如，空气是可压缩流体，因为当你对空气施加压力时，它会变得更稠密。但水基本上是难以压缩的。即使施加很大的压力，水的密度变化也很小。因此，我们通常认为水是不可压缩流体。现在我们来讨论不可压缩流体。假设这是A，速度为v，而这里的速度为v'。很明显，在时间Δt内，A乘以v乘以Δt等于vΔt的距离乘以面积。因此，这就是进入该区域的液体总体积。由于流体不可压缩，流出的量必须等于流入的量。)


So therefore, this is equal to A prime v prime delta t. So A v is equal to A prime v prime. In other words, the velocity is inversely proportional to the area. That's, of course, obvious.If you have a river, which is very narrow, and suddenly becomes very wide, then the fast flow in the narrow part, upon coming to the wide part, would slow down. Obviously. Bernoulli was a very distinguished family.That family produced a number of important mathematicians and scientists. There is a chapter about the Bernoulli family in the book that I had recommended to you called The Name of Mathematics. And Bernoulli's equation is something like this.Suppose you have this is the y-axis.(因此，这等于A'v'Δt。所以Av等于A'v'。换句话说，速度与面积成反比。这当然很明显。如果有一条河流，它非常狭窄，突然变得非常宽阔，那么狭窄部分的快速水流在到达宽阔部分时会减慢。显然。伯努利是一个非常杰出的家族。这个家族产生了许多重要的数学家和科学家。在我推荐给你的那本名为《数学之名》的书中，有一章是关于伯努利家族的。伯努利方程大概是这样的。假设这是y轴。)

This is a vertical upwards. Suppose you have a tube which goes this way.Let us consider a flow which goes this way. And we already know that the area here is smaller, the area here is larger, so therefore the velocity here is larger than the velocity here. So let us say after a delta t, this thing goes to here.So it goes from the solid line to the dotted line. Now we want to consider energy conservation. Again, these are not necessarily... we are not thinking of it as a tube.These are the lines of flow. So the whole thing may be in a very big vessel, but there is a laminar flow, so they are flowing smoothly. So at this point, there is an area.There is A1, and here is A2. At this point, there is pressure 1, there is pressure 2. (这是一条垂直向上的流线。假设有一根管道沿此方向延伸。让我们考虑这样一种流动情况：流体沿此方向流动。我们已经知道这里的截面积较小，而这里的截面积较大，因此此处的流速大于彼处的流速。假设经过Δt时间后，这段流体从实线位置移动到了虚线位置。现在我们要考虑能量守恒问题。再次强调，这些并不一定是...我们并非将其视为实体管道。这些都是流线。整个系统可能处于一个很大的容器中，但由于是层流，流体保持平稳流动。在这个位置存在截面积A1，这里则是A2。此处存在压强P1，而此处存在压强P2。)


At this point, there is V1, there is V2. Now we know A1V1 is equal to A2V2.We already had that. What does energy conservation say? Energy conservation says that the work done on the water in this region is equal to the energy increase. Right? That is what is meant by energy conservation.We are assuming there is no turbulence, so there is energy conservation. But what is the work done on this? This is equal to... In this side, we do work on it, and the force is equal to P1A1. That is the force.The distance traveled is equal to V1 delta t. Right? This is the force done on the system. But at this point, the system does work on the outside, so therefore you have to subtract P2A2. P2A2 is the force times the distance traveled.(此时有V1和V2两个速度。现在我们已知A1V1等于A2V2——这个结论之前已经得出。那么能量守恒定律告诉我们什么？它指出：对该区域水所做的功等于其能量增量。对吧？这就是能量守恒的含义。我们假设不存在湍流，因此能量守恒成立。那么具体做了多少功呢？这等于......在左侧区域，我们对其做功，作用力为P1A1（这就是力的大小）。移动距离等于V1乘以Δt。对吧？这是系统接收的功。但在右侧边界，系统对外界做功，因此需要减去P2A2（即P2A2表示力乘以移动距离）。)


It's V2 delta t. So this difference is the total work done on the system. Now what is this one? What is the energy increase? The energy increase is the energy in the middle is not changed. Before delta t and after delta t, it's the same.The material may have changed, but it's the same amount of mass moving with the same velocity at every point, so there is no change. The only change is that in this area and in this area, or in this volume and in this volume. So what is the change? The change is the total.What is the total mass of it? It's A1 V1 delta t. That is the volume times rho. That's the total mass. The total mass times one half V1 squared minus V2 squared.(这是V2乘以Δt。所以这个差值就是系统所做的总功。那么这是什么？能量增加了多少？能量的增加在于中间部分的能量没有变化。在Δt之前和之后，它是相同的。材料可能发生了变化，但每个点上相同质量的物质以相同的速度运动，所以没有变化。唯一的变化是在这个区域和这个区域，或者说在这个体积和这个体积中。那么变化是什么呢？变化就是总量。它的总质量是多少？是A1乘以V1乘以Δt。那就是体积乘以密度ρ。这就是总质量。总质量乘以二分之一V1的平方减去V2的平方。)


V2 squared minus V1 squared. That's the kinetic energy change. Does everybody agree? This part is the mass.One half m V squared is the kinetic energy. So this part is the kinetic energy here, and this part is the kinetic energy here, and so it's the kinetic energy increase is that, plus the potential energy increase. The potential energy increase is the same thing.It's the same mass plus it's rho gh, or it's mgh. So g times y2 minus y1. In the bracket, here's the kinetic energy increase.Here's the potential energy increase. So let's write it out. We have now delta V. Let's write V. The volume is equal to A1 V1 delta t, and it's equal to A2 V2 delta t. So if I rewrite this equation, I get P1 times V1 times this capital V, times V1 times capital V. (V2的平方减去V1的平方。这就是动能的变化。大家都同意吗？这部分是质量。二分之一m乘以V的平方就是动能。所以这部分是这里的动能，这部分是这里的动能，因此动能的增加就是那个，再加上势能的增加。势能的增加也是同样的东西。同样的质量加上ρgh，或者说mgh。所以g乘以y2减去y1。在括号里，这里是动能的增加。这里是势能的增加。让我们把它写出来。我们现在有ΔV。让我们写V。体积等于A1乘以V1乘以Δt，也等于A2乘以V2乘以Δt。所以如果我重写这个方程，我得到P1乘以V1乘以这个大V，乘以V1乘以大V。)

No, no, no.P1 capital V minus P2 capital V is the left side. It's equal to rho V times one-half V2 squared minus V1 squared plus gy2 minus gy1. So if you cancel the V, you get P1 minus P2 is equal to rho one-half rho V2 squared minus V1 squared plus rho gy2 minus y1.Or you get P1 plus one-half rho V1 squared plus rho gy1 is equal to P2 plus one-half rho V2 squared plus rho gy2. That's called Bernoulli's equation. That's 15-20.This is a very useful formula. For example, let's take, if you have a tank of water and you have a little hole near the bottom, then everybody would know that the water would flow out. This is a simple problem, 15-9.So let us apply, we assume that this is smooth flowing. (不，不，不。P1大V减去P2大V是左边。它等于ρV乘以二分之一V2的平方减去V1的平方，再加上gy2减去gy1。所以如果你约去V，就得到P1减去P2等于ρ乘以二分之一ρV2的平方减去V1的平方，再加上ρg乘以y2减去y1。或者你可以得到P1加上二分之一ρV1的平方加上ρgy1等于P2加上二分之一ρV2的平方加上ρgy2。这就是所谓的伯努利方程。这是15-20。这是一个非常有用的公式。例如，假设你有一个水箱，底部有一个小孔，那么每个人都知道水会流出来。这是一个简单的问题，15-9。所以让我们应用一下，我们假设这是平稳流动的。)



If it is too large a height, it could become turbulent. But let us have not too large a height.So suppose this drop of height is H. So we take this point to be one, take this point to be two. At one, there's the atmospheric pressure plus the original velocity of one-half rho V1 squared. But if this is a very small hole, the surface drops down very slowly.So we neglect this. Plus rho gh is equal to, the pressure at this point is rho zero, is P zero. Again, atmospheric pressure plus one-half rho V2 squared plus zero.So since P zero cancels P zero, we get the rho gh is equal to one-half rho V2 squared, which essentially says that the velocity is equivalent to if the thing has to drop down from here to here.(如果高度过大，可能会产生湍流。但我们不希望高度过大。假设这个高度差为H。我们设这个点为1，这个点为2。在点1处，有大气压加上初始速度的二分之一ρV1平方。但如果这是一个非常小的孔，液面下降得非常缓慢。因此我们可以忽略这一项。加上ρgh等于，这个点的压力为ρ零，即P零。同样，大气压加上二分之一ρV2平方加上零。由于P零与P零相互抵消，我们得到ρgh等于二分之一ρV2平方，这实际上表明速度相当于物体从这里落到这里时的速度。)


But that's not strange because by energy conservation, because we obtained this formula through the Bernoulli's equation. The Bernoulli's equation is based on energy conservation.And so therefore, of course we get energy conservation. I advise you to read Chapter 15 very carefully. There are a lot of little discussions.It's... I think you'll gain general information by reading the book. But as far as the physics principles are concerned, we have, in the last 40 minutes, have gone through the important points completely. So we now go to the next chapter, Chapter 16, Oscillations.Everybody knows that if you have oscillation, there's a frequency.(但这并不奇怪，因为根据能量守恒定律，我们是通过伯努利方程得出这个公式的。伯努利方程本身就是基于能量守恒原理建立的，因此我们自然得到了能量守恒的结果。我建议你们仔细阅读第15章，里面有许多细节讨论。我认为通过阅读这本书，你们会获得全面的知识。但就物理原理而言，过去40分钟我们已经完整地梳理了所有重点内容。现在我们将进入下一章——第16章：振动。众所周知，振动必然伴随着频率的存在。)


There's a unit which is called a hertz. One hertz is equal to one cycle per second.And if you have a clock, the pendulum usually has a frequency of one hertz, one cycle per second. When you talk about cycle, it is the return to the original point. If you have a swing, usually the frequency is, let's say, one third of a hertz.But for radio waves, it has a very high frequency. If you go to light waves, light has been known, of course, by mankind since the beginning of history. But it was only after Maxwell that it was recognized that ordinary light, visible light, is an electromagnetic vibration.And that has a very, very high frequency, much higher than, say, radio waves' frequency.(有一个单位叫做赫兹。一赫兹等于每秒一个周期。如果你有一个钟摆，它的频率通常是一赫兹，即每秒一个周期。说到周期，指的是回到原点。比如秋千的频率大约是三分之一赫兹。但无线电波的频率非常高。至于光波，人类自古以来就认识光，但直到麦克斯韦之后，人们才意识到普通可见光也是一种电磁振动。它的频率非常高，远高于无线电波的频率。)


And later on, people found the gamma rays. Gamma rays have even higher frequencies.Now, if you look at the figure 34-1 of the book, it has a spectrum of various vibrations. These different vibrations go from very slow ones to very, very high frequencies. The highest frequencies are gamma rays, or hard gamma rays, or cosmic rays.Cosmic rays, some of them have enormously high frequencies. So, oscillation is a very fundamental phenomenon. It's very, very common.Now, in the book, it writes a typical one-dimensional oscillation. The displacement, x, as a function of t, is written as x0 times cosine omega t plus phi. This x0 is called amplitude, 中文叫振幅.This omega is called angular frequency.(后来，人们又发现了伽马射线。伽马射线的频率更高。如果你看一下书的图34-1，它展示了各种振动的频谱。这些不同的振动从非常缓慢的到频率非常非常高的都有。频率最高的是伽马射线，或者硬伽马射线，或者宇宙射线。宇宙射线中，有些具有极高的频率。因此，振动是一种非常基础的现象，非常非常普遍。书中描述了一个典型的一维振动。位移x作为时间t的函数，可以表示为x0乘以cos(ωt + φ)。这里的x0被称为振幅，中文叫振幅。这个ω被称为角频率。)

Sorry, angular velocity. This phi is called phase angle, or phase constant, or phase constant.And this, what's under the cosine, the whole thing is called the phase. The phase would usually go from 0 to 360 degrees, to 720 degrees, and so on and so forth. That the phase is the most important thing was well known once people began to study, for example, water waves.But we now know in the 20th century that the concept of phase is deeply related. The concept of phase is related to the mathematical structure of the fundamental forces of nature. There are many fundamental forces of nature.I'm sure you know the gravity force is a fundamental force of nature.(抱歉，角速度。这个φ被称为相位角，或相位常数，或相位常数。而这个，余弦函数里面的整个部分，被称为相位。相位通常从0度到360度，再到720度，依此类推。相位是最重要的，这一点在人们开始研究水波等时就已广为人知。但我们现在在20世纪知道，相位的概念与自然界基本力的数学结构密切相关。自然界有许多基本力。我相信你知道重力是自然界的基本力之一。)

Electric and magnetic force is another type of fundamental forces of nature. Then in the 20th century, we know that there are additional forces.There are the so-called strong forces, which determine the structure of nuclei. There are the weak forces, which determine, for example, radioactivity. So in the 20th century, we now know that there are four types of forces.It turns out that all these forces are related to the concept of phase. And in fact, the prevailing theory now is called the gauge theory. The structure of all these four fundamental forces of nature are all gauge theories.But gauge theory is a wrong name. There is a word in English called misnomer. Nomer means naming.Mis is wrong.（电磁力是自然界另一种基本力。到了20世纪，我们认识到还存在其他几种力。所谓的强力决定了原子核的结构，而弱力则决定了放射性等现象。因此，在20世纪，我们了解到共有四种基本力。事实证明，所有这些力都与相位概念相关。实际上，当前的主流理论被称为规范场论。自然界这四种基本力的结构都属于规范场论范畴。但"规范场论"这个名称并不准确。英语中有个词叫"misnomer"（误称），"nomer"意为命名，"mis"表示错误。）


Misnomer means a wrong naming. It shouldn't have been called gauge theory.It should have been called phase theory. Because its basic concept is based on the concept of phase. At the beginning of this year, I gave a talk in Germany, in Ulm.Ulm is the small town where Einstein was born 125 years ago. They had a celebration for the 125th birthday of Einstein. And I gave a talk there.In which I talked about the fundamental contributions of Einstein. And in that talk, I mentioned that what Einstein wanted to do was to understand the structures of all forces. And he wanted to have a unified understanding.It's called a unified theory. He did not succeed in his lifetime. （误称指的是错误的命名。它本不该被称为规范理论，而应被称为相位理论。因为它的基本概念建立在相位概念之上。今年年初，我在德国的乌尔姆做过一次演讲。乌尔姆是125年前爱因斯坦出生的小镇。他们为爱因斯坦125周年诞辰举办了庆祝活动。我在那里发表了演讲，讲述了爱因斯坦的根本性贡献。在那次演讲中，我提到爱因斯坦想要做的是理解所有力的结构。他希望能有一个统一的理解，即所谓的统一理论。他在有生之年未能成功。）


We have not succeeded yet.But we know that one of the key ingredients of the future unified field theory is gauge theory, or in fact, phase theory. So that shows that the concept of phase is of fundamental importance in physics. Now, the equation that gives rise to the phase is, of course, this simple equation.This equation we have written down several times. And we have applied it to a pendulum. We have applied it to a mass attached to a spring.But in those discussions, we did not discuss dissipation. In those examples that we discussed, either a simple swing or a compressed spring, there was energy conservation. But in actual practice, all motion encounters frictions.（我们尚未取得成功。但我们知道，未来统一场论的关键要素之一就是规范理论，或者说实际上是相位理论。这表明相位概念在物理学中具有根本重要性。当然，产生相位的方程就是这个简单的方程。这个方程我们已经写过好几次了。我们曾将它应用于钟摆，也曾用于连接弹簧的质量体。但在那些讨论中，我们并未涉及耗散问题。在我们讨论过的那些例子中——无论是简单的摆动还是压缩的弹簧——都存在能量守恒。然而在实际情况下，所有运动都会遇到摩擦。）


And in particular, you can do an experiment. And the diagram of the experiment is given in the book. Suppose you have a spring here.You attach a mass to it. But you now produce some larger friction than given by air. So, for example, you have a range like this.You attach an object to the mass. And then immerse that object in some liquid. So when the mass moves up and down, this object moves in the liquid and creates a friction.So this way you can study the dissipation. And it turns out that the dissipation follows an equation such that m x double dot is equal to minus k x minus b x dot minus b x dot. x dot is, of course, the velocity.It gives you a force which is proportional to the velocity.（特别是，你可以做一个实验。实验的示意图在书中已经给出。假设这里有一根弹簧，你在上面挂一个质量块。但现在你需要制造比空气阻力更大的摩擦力。例如，你可以设置一个这样的装置：在质量块上附加一个物体，然后将该物体浸入某种液体中。这样，当质量块上下运动时，这个物体在液体中移动并产生摩擦力。通过这种方式，你可以研究能量的耗散。结果表明，耗散遵循的方程是 m x 双点等于负 k x 减 b x 点减 b x 点。x 点当然代表速度。这个方程给出了一个与速度成正比的力。）

So this is the typical harmonic motion with dissipation. And it's usually written in this form.Harmonic motion with dissipation. Why do we call it dissipation? Let us try to look at the energy balance of this equation. We have looked at harmonic motion before.And we have written the conservation energy equation. How did we obtain that? We take this force equation and multiply it by x dot, by velocity. So we now do the same.We get m x double dot x dot is equal to minus k x x dot minus b x dot squared. But this is equal to d dt of one half m x dot squared. It's equal to minus d dt of one half k x squared minus b x dot squared.Or, it's d dt of the kinetic energy, that's this term, plus potential energy, that's this term, is equal to minus b x squared. So, that's it.（所以这就是典型的带耗散的简谐运动。通常写成这种形式。带耗散的简谐运动。为什么称之为耗散呢？让我们试着看看这个方程的能量平衡。我们之前研究过简谐运动。并且写过能量守恒方程。我们是怎么得到的呢？我们取这个力方程，并乘以x点，即速度。现在我们做同样的事情。得到m x双点x点等于负k x x点减b x点平方。但这等于d dt（1/2 m x点平方）。等于负d dt（1/2 k x平方）减b x点平方。或者说，动能（即这一项）加上势能（即这一项）的d dt等于负b x平方。就是这样。）

Total energy, that's the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies, the total energy changes with time, and it's always negative, minus Bx dot squared. And that's why this is called dissipation. It's Bv squared.It's proportional to the velocity squared. That also shows that B has to be positive, because dissipation always decreases the total energy, decreases the total mechanical energy. Actually, later on we learn that if you include the heat energy, then what is lost in the mechanical energy goes into heat.So once you understand that, you eventually find out that if you add the heat energy, then the total energy is not changed. What happens is that you are changing the mechanical energy into heat energy. (总能量，即动能与势能之和，会随时间变化，且始终为负值，减去Bx点平方。这就是所谓的耗散现象。它等于Bv平方，与速度的平方成正比。这也表明B必须为正数，因为耗散总是会降低总能量，减少总的机械能。实际上，我们稍后会了解到，如果计入热能，那么机械能损失的部分会转化为热能。一旦理解了这一点，最终你会发现，若加上热能，总能量其实并未改变。实际发生的是机械能向热能的转化过程。)

And after that is understood, people ask, can I change heat energy back into mechanical energy? Answer, no. And that is the second law of thermodynamics. We'll come to that. So the simple statement of the second law of thermodynamics is that you can change mechanical energy by various means, by friction, into heat energy.But you cannot let change heat energy into mechanical energy. Okay, now we want to deal with the mathematics of this boxed equation, the harmonic motion with dissipation. This equation is a second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation.Second-order because you have a second derivative. Linear because everything is either x or x dot or x. (在理解了这一点之后，人们会问，我能把热能变回机械能吗？答案是不能。这就是热力学第二定律。我们稍后会讲到。所以热力学第二定律的简单表述就是，你可以通过各种方式，比如摩擦，把机械能变成热能。但你不能让热能变回机械能。好的，现在我们要处理这个框起来的方程的数学问题，也就是带有耗散的简谐运动。这个方程是一个二阶线性齐次微分方程。二阶是因为你有二阶导数。线性是因为每一项要么是x，要么是x的一阶导数，要么是x的二阶导数。)


It's only the first power. Homogeneous in the sense that every term is the same order.If you have something on the right-hand side which is not proportional to x, then it's not homogeneous. So this is called homogeneous linear differential equation of second-order. For such homogeneous differential equations, there is a trick.The trick depends on the fact that the exponential function, let's take exponential i alpha t. If I differentiate the exponential function, I get the same exponential function multiplied by constant. So if you repeatedly differentiate it, you do not get new functions. You only get the same function multiplied by different constants.And that is the way to solve such equation. (这只是第一项。齐次性指的是每一项的阶数相同。如果右边有不与x成比例的东西，那它就不是齐次的。所以这被称为二阶齐次线性微分方程。对于这类齐次微分方程，有一个技巧。这个技巧依赖于指数函数的性质，比如取指数函数e^(iαt)。如果我对指数函数求导，我会得到同一个指数函数乘以一个常数。所以如果你反复求导，你不会得到新的函数，只会得到同一个函数乘以不同的常数。这就是解这类方程的方法。)

So we try. We try a solution.We try x is equal to x zero times exponential i alpha t. How do I know I should try this? I just said that because when I differentiate, I get back the same. If I start with, let's say, x to the fifth power, if I differentiate it, it becomes x to the fourth power, and that's not the same as the original one. So that's very bad for trying to solve this equation.But the exponential has the property that it doesn't change form. It only becomes multiplied by something. So if I substitute that into this equation, into the original equation, I get m x zero times exponential i alpha t. The second derivative becomes i alpha squared.Each time I differentiate, I get the i alpha down.(所以我们尝试。我们尝试一个解。我们尝试x等于x零乘以e的iαt次方。我怎么知道应该尝试这个？我这么说是因为当我求导时，会得到相同的形式。如果我从x的五次方开始，求导后会变成x的四次方，这就和原来的不一样了。所以这对解这个方程来说非常不利。但指数函数的特性就是形式不变，只会被乘以某个数。所以如果我把它代入这个方程，代入原方程，我会得到mx零乘以e的iαt次方。二阶导数就变成了iα的平方。每次求导，我都会得到iα。)


And the next one is b. I differentiate once, so I get the one i alpha. The last one is k. So do you agree that this is the equation? So that means I get, this is not zero, so this has to be equal to zero.So I get minus alpha squared plus i b alpha plus k is equal to zero. No more x. So that determines alpha. So this is a quadratic equation, so we get alpha is equal to, sorry, m. This is wrong.Minus m. So it's equal to 2m i b plus minus square root of minus b squared, or i b squared plus 4mk. Let's write that as b over 2m i plus minus omega zero, where omega zero is equal to square root of 4mk minus b squared divided by 2m. Did I make a mistake? Correct.So I can take either the plus sign or the minus sign. (接下来是b。我进行一次微分，得到1乘以i乘以α。最后一个是k。那么你们同意这个方程吗？这意味着我得到的结果中，这部分不为零，所以这部分必须等于零。因此，我得到负α平方加上i乘以b乘以α加上k等于零。不再有x了。这就确定了α的值。这是一个二次方程，所以我们得到α等于，抱歉，应该是m。这里错了。应该是负m。所以它等于2m乘以i乘以b加减根号下负b平方，或者说i乘以b平方加上4mk。我们可以将其写成b除以2m乘以i加减ω₀，其中ω₀等于根号下4mk减去b平方除以2m。我有没有算错？没错。所以我可以选择加号或减号。)


So let's first take the plus sign. If I take the plus sign, I get x is equal to x zero times exponential i, exponential i t times b over 2m i plus omega zero.And that, according to what we just did, is a complex solution, but it is a solution. However, if I take the minus sign, I would get this. But this is equal to x zero times exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential i t omega zero.This one is equal to x zero exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential minus i t omega zero. So I get two solutions. Both of them have a real damping term.This is called damping, damping term. It's an exponentially decreasing function of time. (那么我们先来看加号的情况。如果我选择加号，得到的解是x等于x零乘以e的i次方，再乘以e的（b/2m乘以i加上ω₀）乘以t次方。根据我们刚才的推导，虽然这是个复数解，但它确实是一个有效解。但如果我选择减号，就会得到这个结果。这等于x零乘以e的（-b/2m乘以t）次方，再乘以e的（i乘以ω₀乘以t）次方。而这个等于x零乘以e的（-b/2m乘以t）次方，再乘以e的（-i乘以ω₀乘以t）次方。这样就得到了两个解。这两个解都包含一个实数衰减项——这就是所谓的阻尼项。它是一个随时间呈指数衰减的函数。)

If the coefficient in front of t is small, if b is almost zero, in other words, if it's a very frictionless, almost frictionless motion, then this exponential exponent is very small, and it takes a long time for it to damp down.T has to be very large for that exponential function to die down. So that's called slow damping. But then we have these two exponentials, and these are complex.Now, we have two different solutions. Since the original equation is linear, I can take any coefficient of the first solution, add it to any coefficient of the second solution, I still get a solution, because the original equation was linear. So once you understand that you know what is the real solution, you just take the two of them.(如果t前面的系数很小，如果b几乎为零，换句话说，如果这是一个几乎没有摩擦的运动，那么这个指数项的指数就非常小，需要很长时间才能衰减。为了使这个指数函数衰减，T必须非常大。这就是所谓的慢阻尼。但我们还有这两个指数项，它们是复数。现在，我们有两个不同的解。由于原方程是线性的，我可以取第一个解的任意系数，加上第二个解的任意系数，仍然得到一个解，因为原方程是线性的。所以一旦你理解了这一点，你就知道真正的解是什么，你只需要取这两个解。)


For example, if you add them with the same coefficient, you get a cosine. If you subtract them and multiply it by i, you get a sine function. So therefore, what do you get in general? So in general, these are special solutions.The general solution is a linear combination of the two, and so the general solution, general real solution, is x equal to some x0 times this damping factor, minus b t over 2m, times cosine of omega 0 t plus phi. Does everybody understand this last step? Why the sum of these two becomes this? It's trivial, but you have to go through that argument. So think of it.You have to be totally familiar with why those two special solutions, when you multiply by proper coefficients and add, comes to this form. (例如，如果你用相同的系数相加，就会得到一个余弦函数。如果相减并乘以i，就会得到一个正弦函数。那么，一般情况下你会得到什么？因此，这些都是特解。通解是两者的线性组合，所以一般的实数解是x等于某个x0乘以这个阻尼因子，减去b t除以2m，乘以omega 0 t加上phi的余弦函数。大家都理解最后这一步吗？为什么这两者的和会变成这样？这很简单，但你必须通过这个论证。所以想想看。你必须完全熟悉为什么这两个特解，当你乘以适当的系数并相加时，会变成这种形式。)

This form, this cosine of two things can be expanded into a cosine term plus a sine term, and each of them can be written as the linear combination of these two, and vice versa. Any real linear combination of those two has to be of this form.Now, if I plot this curve, first I can plot this explanation function. This explanation function goes like this. And when this cosine becomes one, it touches this curve.When cosine becomes minus one, it touches the reflected curve. So the x oscillates between these two. So therefore, you get when t is equal to zero, this term is one, so you get some phase.So you get something like this. I did very well. It looks pretty good.All oscillations follow this. (这个表达式，即这两个量的余弦函数，可以展开为一个余弦项加上一个正弦项，每一项都可以写成这两个量的线性组合，反之亦然。任何这两个量的实数线性组合都必须符合这种形式。现在，如果我绘制这条曲线，首先我可以绘制这个解释函数。这个解释函数是这样的。当这个余弦值为1时，它接触到这条曲线。当余弦值为-1时，它接触到反射后的曲线。因此，x在这两条曲线之间振荡。所以，当t等于0时，这一项为1，你会得到某个相位。因此，你会得到类似这样的图形。我做得很好，看起来相当不错。所有的振荡都遵循这个规律。)

If you have a very small damping, then you can go on and on and on. The book has a diagram with a much smaller damping than what I have.How do you count the damping? You count the number of oscillations before it goes down by a factor of two. And this one damps down maybe after six cycles. In the book, I think that one has maybe damps down by a factor of two only after maybe 20 cycles.But now one can make oscillations with very, very small damping, such that you can go to billions of oscillations without any real change of the amplitude. What we have done in the previous section is to look at the damped simple harmonic oscillator. (如果阻尼非常小，那么振动可以持续很久很久。书上有一幅图，其中的阻尼比我这里的小得多。如何计算阻尼呢？你可以数一数振幅减半前振动了多少次。这个例子中大概六次振动后振幅就减半了。而书上那个例子，我记得大概要20次振动后振幅才会减半。但现在我们可以制造出阻尼极其微小的振动系统，使得振幅在数十亿次振动后都不会发生明显变化。我们在上一节中研究的是有阻尼的简谐振动系统。)


That is when we come to electricity, to alternating currents, that becomes an extremely important subject.In fact, the whole electric engineering department used to study only such type of equations. However, an even more important one is that the motion is periodically subject to an external force. So that's called forced oscillation.Forced oscillation has an equation like this. But it has something on the... Every term in here is a force, of course, because mx double dot is a force. Suppose there's a force which is, let's say, cosine omega t plus, let's say, phi one.This omega is the external frequency. We had omega zero. Omega zero is the natural frequency.(当我们谈到电学和交流电时，这便成为一个极其重要的课题。事实上，整个电气工程系过去只研究这类方程。然而，更关键的是运动受到周期性外力作用的情况，这被称为受迫振动。受迫振动的方程如下所示。当然，这里的每一项都代表一个力，因为mx双点符号表示的就是力。假设有一个力，比如，可以表示为余弦ωt加上φ₁。这里的ω是外部频率。我们之前有ω₀，ω₀是固有频率。)

Omega may...this external frequency may or may not be equal to omega zero. So that's called forced oscillation. So we now want to find a solution of this equation.We try...it's clear that learning from what we had done before, we should again use complex variables and only worry about how to add the solutions, add complex solutions to eventually make it real. Why do we do that? Because the exponential function, exponential i alpha t, has the nice property that every time we differentiate, you do not change the form of the equation. So should we try exponential i alpha t? No, because if we try exponential i alpha t, the x double dot is exponential i alpha t, x dot is exponential i alpha t, x is exponential i alpha t, but on the right-hand side, it's exponential i omega t, and that doesn't work.(欧米伽可能...这个外部频率可能与欧米伽零相等，也可能不相等。这就是所谓的受迫振动。因此，我们现在想找到这个方程的解。我们尝试...很明显，根据我们之前的经验，我们应该再次使用复数变量，只需考虑如何将解相加，将复数解相加最终使其变为实数解。我们为什么要这样做呢？因为指数函数，即e的iαt次方，有一个很好的性质，即每次我们求导时，方程的形式不会改变。那么我们应该尝试e的iαt次方吗？不，因为如果我们尝试e的iαt次方，x的二阶导数是e的iαt次方，x的一阶导数是e的iαt次方，x本身也是e的iαt次方，但在方程的右边是e的iωt次方，这样行不通。)

You get an equation which the left side and the right side do not match. So what should we try? Obviously, we should try exponential i omega t, because then every term is i omega t. So we are going to try x equal to x zero exponential i omega t. So we put that in there. Then we get x zero exponential i omega t times m times double dot.I get i omega squared plus b x dot, so I get i omega plus k. That's the left side. And the right side, the original, I told you that we are going to worry about the complexity afterwards. So we now just write f exponential i omega t. So that's a brilliant idea, because both sides have exponential i omega t. So therefore, so we get x zero times minus m omega squared plus b i omega plus k is equal to f. No more x.(你得到了一个左右两边不相等的方程。那么我们该尝试什么？显然，我们应该尝试指数形式的iωt，因为这样每一项都是iωt。所以我们将尝试x等于x₀乘以e的iωt次方。我们把这个代入方程。然后我们得到x₀乘以e的iωt次方乘以m乘以二阶导数。我得到iω的平方加上b乘以x的一阶导数，也就是iω加上k。这是左边。右边，原始的方程，我告诉过你我们稍后会处理复数部分。所以我们现在只写f乘以e的iωt次方。这是个绝妙的主意，因为两边都有e的iωt次方。因此，我们得到x₀乘以负mω平方加上b乘以iω加上k等于f。不再有x了。)

So x zero is equal to f divided by minus f divided by m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. X zero is the amplitude of the oscillation, and the denominator is a complex number.To understand how this complex number looks like, let's call it defined to be m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. Let us now go back to the k. Now we had the equation before, namely k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. Previously we had the equation for k. k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. So I substitute that in there.I get m omega squared minus b i omega plus. So something's wrong. Just a minute.I did I get a sign wrong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Minus m alpha squared plus b i alpha.(所以x零等于f除以负f除以mω平方减b iω加k。X零是振荡的振幅，而分母是一个复数。为了理解这个复数是什么样子，我们称它为定义为mω平方减b iω加k。现在让我们回到k。之前我们有方程，即k等于mα平方减i bα。之前我们有k的方程。k等于mα平方减i bα。所以我把它代入那里。我得到mω平方减b iω加。所以有些不对劲。等一下。我是不是弄错了符号。是的，是的，是的。减mα平方加b iα。)


So that is equal to m omega squared minus alpha squared plus b i or minus b i omega minus alpha. So that is equal to omega minus alpha times m omega plus alpha minus i b. But alpha, by definition, is equal to b over 2m, is the damping factor, plus omega zero. So I substitute that in there.I get the omega minus omega zero minus. There's an i here. Minus b over 2m i times m omega plus m omega zero minus b over 2i plus b over 2 minus i b. Right.Which is equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m i times m omega plus omega zero minus i b over 2. Let us look at this expression. This expression is the product of two numbers. A complex number and another complex number.(所以这等于mω²减去α²加上bi或减去biω减去α。所以这等于(ω - α)乘以(mω + α - ib)。但根据定义，α等于b除以2m，是阻尼因子，加上ω₀。所以我把它代入那里。我得到ω减去ω₀减去。这里有一个i。减去b除以2m i乘以mω加上mω₀减去b除以2i加上b除以2减去ib。对吧。这等于(ω - ω₀ - b/(2m)i)乘以(m(ω + ω₀) - ib/2)。让我们看看这个表达式。这个表达式是两个数的乘积。一个复数乘以另一个复数。)

Take the case of small damping, i.e., omega is much bigger, b over 2m. If omega is very small and is very large compared to b over 2m, that means the damping, you oscillate. If omega is large and the damping is small, that means you oscillate many, many times before it damps.So let's take that case. If that is the case, you see that this term is small. And that means, we'll come back to that.Here, omega and omega zero, so omega and omega zero are both large. We consider omega to be near omega zero. Omega is large.Omega zero is also large. But the difference between omega and omega zero to be small. That difference may be of the same order as this damping term.(以阻尼较小的情况为例，即ω远大于b/2m。如果ω非常小且远大于b/2m，这意味着在阻尼作用下会发生振荡。如果ω很大而阻尼很小，则意味着在阻尼作用前会进行多次振荡。让我们来看这种情况。如果是这样，你会发现这一项很小。这意味着，我们稍后会再讨论这一点。这里，ω和ω₀，即ω和ω₀都很大。我们认为ω接近ω₀。ω很大。ω₀也很大。但ω和ω₀之间的差异很小。这个差异可能与这个阻尼项的量级相同。)


And here, you see, this is a large number. This is a small number. So d, in that case, is equivalent to, is approximately equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m I. This is a small number.This is a small number. And this, this I b, is essentially 2m omega zero. Because this is small and omega is so equal to, approximately equal to omega zero.So you see that, what is this d? If I take the absolute value of d squared, it's equal to omega minus omega zero squared plus b squared over 4m squared. If I now take the square root of this and put it in the denominator, the x zero absolute value is equal to f absolute value divided by d absolute value. And that's equal to f absolute value divided by this number.(你看，这里有一个大数字。这是一个小数字。所以在这种情况下，d 相当于，约等于 ω 减去 ω₀ 减去 b 除以 2m I。这是一个小数字。这是一个小数字。而这个 I b 基本上是 2m ω₀。因为这是一个小数字，ω 几乎等于 ω₀。所以你看，这个 d 是什么？如果我取 d 的绝对值的平方，它等于 (ω - ω₀)² 加上 b² 除以 4m²。如果我现在对这个取平方根并放在分母中，x₀ 的绝对值等于 f 的绝对值除以 d 的绝对值。那就等于 f 的绝对值除以这个数字。)

So if I plot omega here and let this point be omega equal to omega zero, then this expression One over this expression, the amplitude is like this. When omega is equal to omega zero, the denominator is the smallest. So the amplitude is the largest.And the width here is proportional to this. So this curve is given in the book. It's called the resonance curve.So let me put it in words. We have an oscillator which naturally oscillates with a frequency, and that frequency is called omega zero. I now apply an external frequency on it, which may or may not be the same as omega zero.Then when the external frequency is very different from the natural frequency, the amplitude is small.(因此，如果我将ω画在这里，并设这个点为ω等于ω₀，那么这个表达式的倒数，即振幅，就像这样。当ω等于ω₀时，分母最小，所以振幅最大。这里的宽度与此成正比。这个曲线在书中给出，称为共振曲线。让我用语言描述一下。我们有一个振荡器，它自然以某个频率振荡，这个频率称为ω₀。现在我给它施加一个外部频率，可能与ω₀相同，也可能不同。当外部频率与自然频率相差很大时，振幅就很小。)

But when the external frequency is like the natural frequency, then the amplitude becomes very large. Now this phenomenon we all know.If you have a child on a swing, if you periodically give the child a push, if you push with the same frequency as the natural frequency of the swing, then the swing would go higher and higher. But if you just take a very different frequency, then you will not be able to make the swing go higher and higher. And when you build a bridge, for example, the bridge has a natural frequency.In fact, there are several natural frequencies. We'll come to that. Because what we have been doing is a one-dimensional problem.In general, you have a multi-dimensional problem.(但当外部频率与固有频率相同时，振幅会变得非常大。这个现象我们都很熟悉。比如你推孩子荡秋千，如果你以秋千的固有频率周期性推动，秋千就会越荡越高。但如果用完全不同的频率推动，就无法让秋千持续升高。再比如建造桥梁时，桥梁也有固有频率——实际上往往存在多个固有频率（我们稍后会讲到），因为我们之前讨论的都是一维问题，而现实中通常面临的是多维问题。)

Then there are several ways of vibrating, and they have different frequencies. So it can have more than one natural frequency.If now you apply a force on it, and that force resonates with one of those frequencies, then that mode of vibration will be amplified. And in fact, there was a famous case of a bridge in the United States near Seattle. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.I think it was something like in the 1930s. The engineers did not calculate it correctly. And when the wind reaches a certain speed, it has a driving force with a certain frequency.And it happens that that frequency matched one of the natural frequencies of that bridge. And then it vibrates bigger and bigger. (振动有多种方式，且频率各不相同。因此，物体可能拥有不止一个固有频率。如果此时施加一个外力，且该外力的频率与物体的某一固有频率产生共振，那么该振动模式就会被放大。事实上，美国西雅图附近曾有一座著名的桥梁——塔科马大桥，就发生过这样的案例。大约是在20世纪30年代，工程师们的计算出现了失误。当风速达到一定值时，会产生特定频率的驱动力。而这个频率恰好与桥梁的某一固有频率相匹配，导致桥梁的振动幅度越来越大。)


And I think something like a few hours before the disaster was going to happen, they realized, the city realized, that something very important is going to happen.So they made a movie of it. They took a real movie. And then you can see that one particular vibration becomes amplified.Eventually, the whole bridge collapsed. But in that case, there was a record. There's a visual record of that particular collapse.That is a very famous movie. You may be able to get it from the Internet. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.So the engineers in constructing anything had to estimate for every mode of vibration the natural frequency. And then try to do it in such a manner that any external force, the vibration, the frequency, would not be close to any of the natural frequencies to avoid the disasters. (我认为就在灾难发生前的几个小时，他们意识到，这座城市意识到，有非常重要的事情即将发生。所以他们拍了一部电影。他们拍摄了一部真实的电影。然后你可以看到一种特定的振动被放大了。最终，整座桥倒塌了。但在那次事件中，有记录。有那次特定倒塌的视觉记录。那是一部非常著名的电影。你也许可以从互联网上找到它。它被称为塔科马大桥。因此，工程师们在建造任何东西时都必须估算每一种振动模式的固有频率。然后尽量以这样的方式去做，使得任何外力、振动、频率都不会接近任何固有频率，以避免灾难。)

At this point, we have a complex solution.But we can have two different complex solutions, and then you can combine them to make a real solution. So I will not go through that in detail. But you try to puzzle that out.But I want to change it into a slightly different subject. And that is what happens if you have many degrees of freedom. What we had talked about is a one-dimensional problem.First, let's talk about the harmonic motion. Harmonic motion for small amplitudes. For discussing this, we go back to the equation of motion.But instead of talking about the equation of motion, we talk about the energy, total energy. Total energy is equal to kinetic energy plus potential energy.(至此，我们得到了一个复数解。但实际上可以存在两个不同的复数解，将它们组合起来就能构成实数解。这部分我就不详细展开了，你们可以自行思考推演。现在我想把话题稍微转向另一个方向——当系统具有多个自由度时会发生什么？之前我们讨论的都是一维问题。首先来谈谈简谐运动，即小振幅条件下的振动。为了分析这个问题，我们需要回到运动方程。不过我们不直接讨论运动方程，而是从能量角度切入，考察总能量。总能量等于动能与势能之和。)


If you have several degrees of freedom, for example, you have a body like a molecule.It has several degrees of freedom. So the kinetic energy, typically, is like a summation of one-half m i x i dot squared. Where x i, for example, you have a molecule.Each molecule has a fixed position when it's not vibrating. x i is now the deviation from equilibrium position. For example, a water molecule consists of one oxygen and two hydrogens.Because of the full structure, it has a certain angle. So this is the position at rest. But when it starts to vibrate, each of them moves.So this one, so you have three x i's, which are the deviations of the oxygen from its rest position. (如果你有多个自由度，比如你有一个像分子这样的物体。它有几个自由度。所以动能通常是像对1/2 m_i x_i点平方的求和。这里的x_i，比如说你有一个分子。每个分子在不振动时都有一个固定的位置。x_i现在是偏离平衡位置的量。例如，一个水分子由一个氧原子和两个氢原子组成。由于完整的结构，它有一定的角度。所以这是静止时的位置。但当它开始振动时，每个原子都会移动。所以这里你有三个x_i，它们是氧原子偏离其静止位置的量。)


And you have three for this, three for this. So you would have altogether, to start with, nine x's.So you have x1 up to x9. Each of them is the deviation of that particular molecule from the original at rest position. So the kinetic energy is like that.The potential energy, you expand into a power series of that x. So it's equal to a constant plus a linear term and a quadratic term. A linear term meaning it's a proponent of x. A quadratic term is a proponent of x squared plus a cubic term. The constant doesn't matter.All energies, because you usually take the derivative of the energy, so therefore that constant drops out. The linear term has to be zero, because if all the x's are equal to zero, it's like the bottom of the potential.(对于这个，你有三个，对于那个，也有三个。所以一开始你总共有九个x。也就是说，你有x1到x9。每一个都代表特定分子相对于原始静止位置的偏移。因此，动能是这样的。势能则展开为x的幂级数。它等于一个常数加上线性项和二次项。线性项意味着它是x的一次方。二次项是x的平方项，再加上三次项。常数项无关紧要。因为通常你会对能量求导，所以常数项会被消去。线性项必须为零，因为如果所有的x都等于零，那就相当于势能的最低点。)

So this term is equal to zero, because x i equal to zero is the static situation.Does everybody understand what I'm talking about? Let's take a one-dimensional problem. We have a u. u is the potential energy. And we have a curve like this.And we are now talking about a equilibrium point. At the equilibrium point, the potential energy is a quadratic expression, no linear term. If it's at this point, there's a linear term.But that's not a point of equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium, the linear term always vanishes. So that's what I'm talking about, because that's why this is zero.So therefore, we only have a quadratic term. And these cubic terms for small vibrations are very small, so we also drop them.(因此这一项等于零，因为x等于零对应的是静态情形。大家都明白我在说什么吗？让我们以一维问题为例。设u为势能，其曲线形状如此。现在我们讨论的是平衡点。在平衡点处，势能是二次表达式，不存在线性项。若处于这个位置（非平衡点），则存在线性项。但在平衡点处，线性项总是消失的——这正是我所说的原理，也是此项为零的原因。因此我们仅保留二次项。至于三次项，对于微小振动而言数值极小，故同样予以忽略。)

So the potential energy becomes essentially just a quadratic expression.In other words, the potential energy is equal to summation a i j x i x j. That's a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression like this can be written as a matrix. It's x times the a times x. So let me summarize what I said.For a vibration of a molecule, in fact, it can be of a crystal, you have many, many coordinates. And the kinetic energy is the sum of x i dot squared with some coefficients proportional to the masses. The potential energy is essentially a quadratic expression, which can be written in this form.So the potential energy is determined by a square matrix. That square matrix can be made symmetrical, because x1, x2, and x2, x1, you can combine into one term and divide by two. (因此，势能本质上就是一个二次表达式。换句话说，势能等于求和a_ij x_i x_j。这就是一个二次表达式。像这样的二次表达式可以写成矩阵形式，即x乘以a再乘以x。让我总结一下刚才所说的内容。对于分子（实际上也可以是晶体）的振动来说，会有很多很多的坐标。动能是x_i点平方的和，其中系数与质量成正比。势能本质上是一个二次表达式，可以写成这种形式。因此，势能是由一个方阵决定的。这个方阵可以是对称的，因为x1x2和x2x1可以合并成一项并除以二。)

So therefore, A is real symmetrical.A real symmetrical matrix by a linear transformation can become diagonal. We have used that theorem. So that means if I change from the x, which is a series of x's, into x prime, so I write x as gamma times x prime.I transform x into x prime. Then in terms of x prime, it becomes diagonal. In other words, the potential energy in x prime becomes omega 1 x1 squared plus omega 2 squared x2 squared, no cross term.And these omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 are the natural frequencies. So let me summarize what I just said. It's a fundamental idea.It's actually extremely simple. When you are near equilibrium, if you neglect the triple cubic terms and high order terms, then the potential energy is quadratic.(因此，A是一个实对称矩阵。通过线性变换，实对称矩阵可以变为对角矩阵。我们使用了这个定理。这意味着，如果我从x（一系列x）变换到x'，即我将x表示为γ乘以x'，我将x转换为x'。那么，在x'的表示下，它就变成了对角矩阵。换句话说，x'中的势能变为ω₁x₁² + ω₂²x₂²，没有交叉项。而这些ω₁、ω₂、ω₃就是自然频率。让我总结一下我刚才所说的。这是一个基本概念。实际上非常简单。当你接近平衡点时，如果忽略三次项和高阶项，那么势能就是二次的。)


Any quadratic form can be diagonalized, and the diagonal coefficients are the natural frequencies.So when you have the Tacoma Bridge, the Tacoma Bridge has several motions. It can do this, it can do this, it can twist. So the engineers have certain approximations of a certain number of frequencies.I don't know how many. And they can calculate that matrix and can diagonalize it. So by computation, they can know the natural frequency.And the trick is to make that bridge such that the prevailing wind in that area would not generate a force frequency which is near any of those natural frequencies. What I just said in the last ten minutes is a general principle. （任何二次型都可以对角化，而对角线上的系数就是固有频率。以塔科马大桥为例，这座桥有多种运动方式——它可以这样摆动，也可以那样摆动，还能发生扭转。工程师们会近似计算出若干固有频率（具体数量我不清楚），通过构建矩阵并对其进行对角化运算，就能求出这些固有频率。关键在于设计桥梁时，必须确保当地盛行风产生的激振频率不会接近任何固有频率。以上这十分钟所讲的内容，就是最核心的原理。）


We know that all motions, when they are small, are likely to become almost likely to become damped simple harmonic motions.And with damped simple harmonic motions, there are two fundamental quantities. One is the damping term, the magnitude of the damping term. The other is the frequency.And that, in fact, applies to all motions. Okay, thank you. Thank you.（我们知道，所有微小运动都容易近似成为阻尼简谐运动。而阻尼简谐运动有两个基本量：一个是阻尼项的大小，另一个是频率。事实上，这适用于所有运动。好的，谢谢。谢谢。）
