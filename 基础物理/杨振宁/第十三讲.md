For a planar figure, the axis perpendicular to the plane through the center of mass is the principal axis of inertia. One can easily prove this, because if you choose the plane to be the xy plane, then all particles have zi equal to zero.All the z's are equal to zero. So if you look at the three by three matrix, the last column and the last row all have zero except for the diagonal element. So that proves that the z axis is the principal axis of inertia.（这一点很容易证明，因为如果你选择 xy 平面作为参考平面，那么所有粒子的 z 坐标都为零。所有的 z 值都等于零。因此，当你观察 3×3 矩阵时，除了对角线元素外，最后一列和最后一行的所有元素都为零。这就证明了 z 轴是惯性的主轴。）

Next we take up the subject of the dynamics of rigid bodies. Now we already had the formula that the total angular momentum time derivative is equal to summation of the torques. Let us assume v center of mass equal to zero.In other words, we move with the center of mass. So the body then rotates around the center of mass. （接下来我们讨论刚体的动力学问题。我们已经知道总角动量的时间导数等于力矩的总和。让我们假设质心的速度为零。换句话说，我们随质心一起运动。因此，物体将围绕质心旋转。对于一个平面图形，通过质心垂直于平面的轴是惯性主轴。）

总角动量的时间导数 $$\dot{\vec{L}}=\sum \vec{r}_{i} \times \vec{F}_{i}$$假设 $\vec{v}_{\text{com}}=0$，角动量为$$\vec{L}=I_{1}\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+I_{2}\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+I_{3}\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{3}$$角速度 $$\omega = \omega_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{3}$$
The angular momentum, we choose the center of mass to be origin.Around the origin, namely the center of mass, there are three principal axes of inertia. So the angular momentum is equal to I1 omega 1 E1 plus I2 omega 2 E2 plus I3 omega 3 E3. E1, E2, E3 are the three unit vectors along the principal axis of inertia.And the angular momentum omega has the components. So omega is equal to omega 1 E1 plus omega 2 E2 plus omega 3 E3. Now when we calculate the derivative, now we want to calculate L dot.L changes with time because omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 change with time.（角动量，我们选择质心为原点。围绕原点，即质心，有三个主惯性轴。因此，角动量等于I1ω1E1加上I2ω2E2加上I3ω3E3。E1、E2、E3是沿主惯性轴的三个单位向量。而角速度ω有分量。所以ω等于ω1E1加上ω2E2加上ω3E3。现在当我们计算导数时，我们想计算L点。L随时间变化，因为ω1、ω2、ω3随时间变化。）

The angular velocities change with time. And E1, E2, E3 also change with time.So let us, for example, ask what is E1 dot? E1 dot is omega cross E1. E1 is a unit vector attached to the rigid body. So the rigid body rotates, E1 also rotates.And its velocity, the velocity of the end of E1 is equal to omega cross E1. So now we can calculate L dot. L dot is equal to I1 omega 1 E1 plus I2 omega 2 E2 plus I3 omega 3 dot E3.That's due to the change of omega 1, omega 2, omega 3. But we also have to add omega 1 times omega cross E1 plus I2 omega 2 omega cross E2 plus I3 omega 3 omega cross E3. Because the E's also rotate. (角速度随时间变化。E1、E2、E3也随时间变化。那么，例如，我们问E1的点积是什么？E1的点积是ω叉乘E1。E1是附着在刚体上的单位向量。因此，刚体旋转时，E1也会旋转。它的速度，即E1末端的速度等于ω叉乘E1。现在我们可以计算 L 的点积。L 的点积等于I1ω1E1加上I2ω2E2加上I3ω3的点积E3。这是由于ω1、ω2、ω3的变化。但我们还必须加上I1ω1乘以ω叉乘E1，加上I2ω2乘以ω叉乘E2，加上I3ω3乘以ω叉乘E3。因为E向量也在旋转。)

$$\dot{\vec{e}_{1}} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{1}$$
所以：$$\begin{align}
\dot{\vec{L}}= & I_{1}\dot{\omega}_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+I_{2}\dot{\omega}_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+I_{3}\dot{\omega}_{3}\vec{e}_{3} \\
&+I_{1}\omega_{1}(\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{1})+I_{2}\omega_{2}(\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{2})+I_{3}\omega_{3}(\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{3})
\end{align}$$其中 $$\begin{align}
\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{1}&=(\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{3}) \times \vec{e}_{1}=-\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{3}+\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{2} \\[1.2ex]
\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{2}&=(\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{3}) \times \vec{e}_{2}=\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{3}-\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{1}  \\[1.2ex]
\vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{3}&=(\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{1}+\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{2}+\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{3}) \times \vec{e}_{3}=-\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{2}+\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{1}
\end{align}$$
所以$$\begin{align}
\vec{T} = \dot{\vec{L}}\quad= & \quad I_{1}\dot{\omega}_{1}\vec{e}_{1}\quad + \quad I_{2}\dot{\omega}_{2}\vec{e}_{2}\quad + \quad I_{3}\dot{\omega}_{3}\vec{e}_{3} \\
&\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad+ I_{1}\omega_{1}\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{2} \quad -  I_{1}\omega_{1}\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{3} \\
&-I_{2}\omega_{2}\omega_{3}\vec{e}_{1} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad+ I_{2}\omega_{2}\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{3}  \\
&+I_{3}\omega_{3}\omega_{2}\vec{e}_{1} \quad- I_{3}\omega_{3}\omega_{1}\vec{e}_{2} 
\end{align}$$
But omega cross E1 is equal to omega 1 E1 plus omega 2 E2 plus omega 3 E3 cross E1.E1 cross E1 is zero. E2 cross E1 is minus E3. So we get omega 2 E3 plus omega 3 E2.So we substitute that in there. L dot is equal to I1 omega 1 dot E1 plus I2 omega 2 E2 plus I3 omega 3 dot E3. Plus I1 omega 1 times that.So that's plus I1 omega 1 times this, which is omega 3 E2 minus I1 omega 1 omega 2 E3. I will put that in this row. Then I have I2, I2 omega 2. I get minus I2 omega 2 omega 3 E1 plus I2 omega 2 omega 1 E3.Then I get plus I3 omega 3 omega 2 E1 minus I3 omega 3 omega 2 omega 1 E2. I merely wrote those three terms along this row, along this row, along this row. （但ω叉乘E1等于ω1E1加ω2E2加ω3E3叉乘E1。E1叉乘E1为零。E2叉乘E1为负E3。因此我们得到ω2E3加ω3E2。于是我们将其代入此处。L点等于I1ω1点E1加I2ω2E2加I3ω3点E3。再加上I1ω1乘以那个。所以就是加上I1ω1乘以这个，即ω3E2减去I1ω1ω2E3。我会把这行放这里。然后我有I2，I2ω2。我得到负I2ω2ω3E1加I2ω2ω1E3。然后我得到加I3ω3ω2E1减I3ω3ω2ω1E2。我只是把这三项沿着这行、这行、这行写下来。）

So, and that's equal to T, the total torque is equal to, total torque is the force, is equal to the time derivative of the angular momentum.So in other words, I have the first component of the torque is equal to the sum of these three terms, is equal to I1 omega 1 dot plus I3 minus I2 times omega 2 omega 3. T2 is equal to I2 omega 2 dot plus I1 minus I2 minus I3 omega 3 omega 1. T3 is equal to I3 omega 3 dot plus I2 minus I1 omega 1 omega 2. You can also write this in the following fashion. You take this formula plus a cyclic permutation, and a cyclic permutation. （所以，这等于T，总扭矩等于，总扭矩就是力，等于角动量的时间导数。换句话说，扭矩的第一个分量等于这三项之和，等于I1乘以ω1的点加上I3减去I2乘以ω2乘以ω3。T2等于I2乘以ω2的点加上I1减去I2减去I3乘以ω3乘以ω1。T3等于I3乘以ω3的点加上I2减去I1乘以ω1乘以ω2。你也可以用以下方式来表达这个公式。你取这个公式加上一个循环置换，再一个循环置换。）

所以扭矩的分量$$\begin{align}
\vec{T}_{1}=I_{1}\dot{\omega}_{1}+(I_{3}-I_{2})\omega_{2}\omega_{3} \\[1.2ex]
\vec{T}_{2}=I_{2}\dot{\omega}_{2}+(I_{1}-I_{3})\omega_{3}\omega_{1} \\[1.2ex]
\vec{T}_{3}=I_{3}\dot{\omega}_{3}+(I_{2}-I_{1})\omega_{1}\omega_{2} \\[1.2ex]
\end{align}$$
The other two are cyclic permutations of this one.Now this is the most important formula, which governs the rotation of the rigid body around its center of mass. It's nonlinear. Nonlinear in the sense that the equation that we want, the solution we want, is omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 as functions of time.Just like for linear motion, you want V1, V2, V3 as functions of time. But this is linear. That means omega occurs only once, but here omega occurs twice.So this is a very complicated equation. （另外两个是它的循环排列。现在这是最重要的公式，它控制着刚体绕其质心的旋转。这个公式是非线性的。非线性指的是我们想要的方程、我们想要的解，即ω1、ω2、ω3作为时间的函数。就像线性运动中你想要V1、V2、V3作为时间的函数一样。但这是线性的，意味着ω只出现一次，而这里ω出现了两次。所以这是一个非常复杂的方程。）


Whenever you have a nonlinear equation, in general the problem becomes much more complicated. So this was a famous problem in the 19th century.In fact, there was a famous romance in the 19th century. There was a beautiful young woman named Sonya Kovaleski. She was a Russian woman who lived from 1850 to 1891.In 1888, when she was 38 years old, she won an important French prize. The French Academy wanted to have some mathematical discussion of the solution of this equation. （当你遇到非线性方程时，问题通常会变得复杂得多。这在 19 世纪曾是个著名难题。实际上，19 世纪还发生过一段著名的浪漫故事。有位名叫索尼娅·柯瓦列夫斯卡娅的美丽年轻女性，这位 1850-1891 年间生活的俄罗斯女性，在 38 岁那年（1888年）获得了法国一项重要奖项。当时法兰西科学院希望就这个方程的解法展开数学探讨。）

So it was a prize, and she won the prize.In fact, it was a very large amount of money. But she had already been famous before that because she was a brilliant mathematician and she was one of the very beautiful women in universities at that time. In those days, in Europe as well as in China, women were discriminated against.The Chinese attitude was that women are bad luck. The attitude in Europe was that beautiful women are dangerous. But she was a Russian woman, and at the age of 20, she came to Berlin as a student.As a student of Waelstrasse. Waelstrasse was 35 years older than Kovaleski. （所以这是一项大奖，而她赢得了这个奖项。事实上，奖金数额非常巨大。但在此之前她已经很有名了，因为她是一位杰出的数学家，也是当时大学里非常美丽的女性之一。在那个年代，无论是在欧洲还是中国，女性都受到歧视。中国人的观念是女人是祸水。欧洲人的观念则是美丽的女人很危险。但她是一位俄罗斯女性，20岁时以学生身份来到柏林，成为魏尔斯特拉斯的学生。魏尔斯特拉斯比柯瓦列夫斯卡娅年长 35 岁。）

And she became his student. Waelstrasse at that time was the most important mathematician in Europe. He was extremely famous. He was, for example, the person who really defined what a rational number was.And he had great contributions to, in fact, all branches of mathematics at that time. So he was a powering figure. And he never married in his life.And here came this young 20-year-old beautiful Russian woman who became his student. But she was not allowed to listen to his lectures because women were not allowed in the lecture halls. So he gave her private letters.（于是她成了他的学生。当时的魏尔斯特拉斯是欧洲最重要的数学家，声名显赫。例如，正是他真正定义了有理数的概念。事实上，他对当时数学的各个分支都做出了巨大贡献，是一位举足轻重的人物。他一生未婚。这时，这位 20 岁的年轻美丽的俄罗斯女子成为了他的学生。但她不被允许听他的讲座，因为女性不允许进入讲堂。因此，他给她私下授课。）


So for four years, she was his student in this manner. And also they had lots of correspondence. But after she died, she died before he did.After she died, he burned all these letters. So one does not really know the details of their relationship. But there were all kinds of rumors.If you want to read about this, you read... I had mentioned to you earlier that there was a very important book called The Man of Mathematics by Bell. And it has been translated into Chinese. And the book is called Shuxue Jinyin.That is, I believe, the first book which had a kind of a biography of Weierstrass and Kovalevsky. But in recent years, biography writing about scientists has become a fashion in America and Europe. So there has been several books published, both of Weierstrass' biography and of Sonja Kowalewski's biography. （就这样，她以这种方式做了他四年的学生。他们之间还有大量的书信往来。但她先于他去世后，他就把这些信件全部烧毁了。所以人们并不真正了解他们关系的细节。但各种流言蜚语满天飞。如果你想了解这方面的情况，可以读读...我之前跟你提过贝尔写的那本非常重要的书《数学大师》。这本书已被翻译成中文，书名叫做《数学精英》。我相信这是第一本包含魏尔斯特拉斯和柯瓦列夫斯卡娅传记的书。但近年来，科学家传记写作在欧美已成为一种风尚。因此已经出版了好几本书，既有关于魏尔斯特拉斯的传记，也有关于索菲娅·柯瓦列夫斯卡娅的传记。）


（17.16）







Now let us take the special case of free, free rigid body. That means the torque is equal to zero, if the body is free.Then we have I1 dot. If I multiply the first, if I multiply this one by omega 1, and multiply this by omega 2, and multiply this by omega 3 and add, I get I1 omega 1. The right hand side cancels because every line is proportional to omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, and the six I terms cancel each other, so therefore it's equal to zero. （现在让我们以自由刚体这一特例来说明。这意味着如果物体是自由的，扭矩就等于零。那么我们得到I1点。如果我将第一个乘以ω1，这个乘以ω2，这个乘以ω3然后相加，就得到I1ω1。右边会相互抵消，因为每一行都与ω1、ω2、ω3成比例，六个I项相互抵消，因此结果等于零。）


And this I can integrate, so therefore I get one half of I1 omega 1 dot squared plus I2 omega 2 dot squared plus I3 omega 3 dot squared is equal to a constant.That actually is the conservation of energy. We shall come back to this later. Here we just find a mathematical theorem saying that that expression is.But later on we would come to the realization that that expression, in fact, is the energy of rotation. So let us take a special case. （我可以将其积分，因此得到1/2乘以I1乘以ω1点平方加上I2乘以ω2点平方加上I3乘以ω3点平方等于一个常数。这实际上就是能量守恒定律。我们稍后会再讨论这一点。这里我们只是发现了一个数学定理，表明这个表达式成立。但后来我们会意识到，这个表达式实际上就是旋转的能量。让我们来看一个特例。）


Special case one, I1 equal to I2 equal to I3.In that case, you look at these three, because the I's are equal, so this quadratic terms are all zero. So that says omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 are all constants. And that means omega as a vector is a constant, independent of time.So for such a body, when it begins to rotate, it has an axis, and that axis is fixed, and it's a very smooth rotation. If you have a sphere, a sphere has I1 equal to I2, I3, it has that property. （特殊情况一，I1等于I2等于I3。在这种情况下，你看这三个，因为I相等，所以这些二次项都为零。这意味着ω1、ω2、ω3都是常数。也就是说，ω作为一个矢量是恒定的，与时间无关。因此，对于这样的物体，当它开始旋转时，它有一个轴，这个轴是固定的，旋转非常平稳。如果你有一个球体，球体的I1等于I2、I3，它就具有这种特性。）


But not only a sphere, a cube, a cube also has I1, although cube is not spherically symmetrical, but it's I1 is equal to I2 is equal to I3.And you can take any axis, you flip it, it will continue to rotate around that axis. Special case two, I1 is equal to I2 is not equal to I3. Yes, last time we discussed that I1, I2, I3 form a triangle.Now, if if I was equal to I2, not equal to I3, for example, it could be this way. This is I3 or it could be this way. And if it is cylinder, which is very long, it's this way.We said that last time. （但不仅仅是一个球体，立方体也是如此。立方体虽然不具备球对称性，但其I1等于I2等于I3。你可以选择任意轴翻转它，它会继续围绕该轴旋转。第二种特殊情况是I1等于I2但不等于I3。是的，上次我们讨论过I1、I2、I3构成一个三角形。现在，如果I1等于I2但不等于I3，例如，可能是这样。这是I3，或者也可能是这样。如果是非常长的圆柱体，就是这种情况。我们上次已经讨论过这一点。）


If it's a cylinder, which is like a disc, it's like this. But in both these cases, let's see what's going on with the mathematics.In that case, if you look at the first equation, you get I1, omega 1 dot is equal to zero. You get I2, omega 2 dot is equal to I3 minus I1, omega 1, omega 3. I3, omega 3 dot is equal to the same, is equal to minus I3 minus I1, omega 1, omega 2. Out of this, you get omega 1 is equal to a constant. But, but omega 2, omega 1 is a constant.So this omega 1 is a constant. This omega 1 is a constant. Does anybody recognize what should be omega 2 and omega 3? （如果它是一个圆柱体，类似于圆盘，那么就是这样。但在这些情况下，让我们看看数学上发生了什么。在这种情况下，如果你看第一个方程，你会得到I1乘以ω1的点等于零。你会得到I2乘以ω2的点等于I3减去I1乘以ω1乘以ω3。I3乘以ω3的点等于同样的，等于负的I3减去I1乘以ω1乘以ω2。由此，你得到ω1等于一个常数。但是，ω2和ω1是一个常数。所以这个ω1是一个常数。这个ω1是一个常数。有人能认出ω2和ω3应该是什么吗？）


Omega 2 dot is equal to some constant times omega 3. Omega 3 dot is equal to the same constant with a minus sign times omega 2. So that means it's harmonic.Harmonic, that means the sinusoidal functions are harmonic functions of time. In other words, if you take omega 2 second dot, you would get the minus some constant times omega 2. So that means it's a sine wave. So omega 2 and omega 3 goes around the circle.So what happens is that there's a total angular momentum L. L consists, E1 has a E1 component, E2 component, E3 component. （欧米伽2点等于某个常数乘以欧米伽3。欧米伽3点等于同一个常数带负号乘以欧米伽2。这意味着它是简谐的。简谐意味着正弦函数是时间的简谐函数。换句话说，如果你对欧米伽2求二阶导数，你会得到负的某个常数乘以欧米伽2。这意味着它是一个正弦波。因此欧米伽2和欧米伽3围绕圆周运动。那么总角动量L会发生什么呢？L由E1分量、E2分量和E3分量组成。）


So let us say that E1 is, this is I1 omega 1. This, this is I1 omega 1 E1. This is I2 omega 2 E2 plus omega 3 E3.Sorry, this is I3 omega 3 E3. Sorry, I'm confusing you. I sometimes call the fixed one omega 1, sometimes called E3.Okay, let's fix with this. Omega 1 is a constant. So this is I1 omega 1 E1.I'm talking about the case. I'm sorry about this confusion. It's I1 not equal to I2 plus I3.This is I1. This is I1. I talk about the case where I1 is different from I2, I3, but I2 and I3 are equal.In that case, I get this. （那么我们假设E1等于I1乘以ω1。这个，这个就是I1乘以ω1的E1。这个是I2乘以ω2的E2加上ω3的E3。抱歉，应该是I3乘以ω3的E3。抱歉，我有点把你搞糊涂了。我有时把固定的那个称为ω1，有时又叫做E3。好吧，让我们固定一下。ω1是一个常数。所以这个就是I1乘以ω1的E1。我在讨论这种情况。对于这个混淆我很抱歉。是I1不等于I2加I3。这个是I1。这个是I1。我讨论的是I1不同于I2和I3，但I2和I3相等的情况。在这种情况下，我得到了这个。）

So omega 1 is a constant. And L is equal to I1 omega 1 E1 plus I2 omega 2 E2 plus I2 omega 3 E. So these two form a, and the sum of them is equal to L. And L is fixed in space because there's no torque.So L dot is equal to zero. So this is fixed. And omega 1 is a numerical constant.So this length is fixed. And this length is also fixed because out of these equations, you get omega 1 squared, omega 2 squared plus omega 3 squared is equal to a constant. We had that formula earlier.I1 omega 1 squared plus I2 omega 2 squared plus I3 omega 3 squared is equal to a constant. （所以ω₁是一个常数。而L等于I₁ω₁E₁加上I₂ω₂E₂加上I₂ω₃E₃。这两者构成了一个向量，它们的和等于L。由于没有扭矩作用，L在空间中是固定的。因此L的点积等于零。所以这是固定的。ω₁是一个数值常数。所以这个长度是固定的。这个长度也是固定的，因为从这些方程中可以得到ω₁²加上ω₂²加上ω₃²等于一个常数。我们之前有那个公式。I₁ω₁²加上I₂ω₂²加上I₃ω₃²等于一个常数。）


But omega 1 squared itself is a constant. So there's a 2 and 3 part added together.So we have this formula. So the net result of that is that this length is fixed. This length is fixed.So we have a, L is fixed in space. But this triangle rotates around L. Is that clear? Everybody happy? Now, where is omega? Omega is not in the same direction as L because omega is equal to I1 omega 1.（但ω₁的平方本身是一个常数。所以这里有一个2和3部分相加的结果。于是我们得到了这个公式。因此最终结果是这个长度是固定的。这个长度是固定的。所以我们得出a，L在空间中是固定的。但这个三角形会绕着L旋转。清楚了吗？大家都明白了吗？那么，ω在哪里？ω与L不在同一方向上，因为ω等于I₁ω₁。）


So if I draw an omega plot, omega is something like this. Omega is not in the same direction as L. So the net result is there's an L. There's this right angle, and that right angle is making a sinusoidal motion.So it goes around this L axis. But at every moment, the L is not, omega is not parallel to L. If you think about this, what that means is that the body will rotate, but it not only rotates around this, it performs a rotation. （所以如果我画一个欧米茄图，欧米茄大概是这样的。欧米茄和L的方向并不相同。最终的结果是有一个L。这里有一个直角，而这个直角正在进行正弦运动。所以它是绕着这个L轴旋转的。但在每一刻，L和欧米茄并不平行。如果你仔细想想，这意味着物体会旋转，但它不仅仅是绕着这个旋转，它还会进行一种旋转运动。）


Think of that body as a plane.A plane body is like this. If it's a plane, then I1 is equal to twice, is equal to I2 plus I3. I1 is equal to I2 plus I3.I1 is equal to twice I2. So that is a special case. In that case, this is L, and this is a plane.The plane is perpendicular to U1, and it rotates. But because omega is not parallel to L, the plane rotates around L. But in the plane, it still rotates inside the plane. So it's a very complicated motion.It's a motion which combines both a rotation of the plane and a rotation inside. （想象那个物体是一个平面。平面物体是这样的。如果它是一个平面，那么I1等于两倍，等于I2加I3。I1等于I2加I3。I1等于两倍的I2。所以这是一个特殊情况。在这种情况下，这是L，这是一个平面。这个平面垂直于U1，并且它会旋转。但由于ω不与L平行，这个平面会围绕L旋转。但在平面内部，它仍然在旋转。所以这是一个非常复杂的运动。这是一种结合了平面旋转和内部旋转的运动。）


Special case three. I1 is not equal to I2.It's not equal to I3. It's not equal to I1. You can see that this is even more complicated than the second case.And that is the problem on which Madame Kovalevsky won that prize. Next, we talk about rotational energy. Total kinetic energy is equal to kinetic energy of center of mass plus kinetic energy in center of mass.In center of mass system. We have proven this, I think, last week. What is the kinetic energy in center of mass? （第三种特殊情况。I1不等于I2，不等于I3，也不等于I1。可以看到这比第二种情况更为复杂。而这就是科瓦列夫斯卡娅夫人获奖所解决的问题。接下来，我们讨论转动动能。总动能等于质心动能加上质心系中的动能。在质心系中。我想我们上周已经证明过这一点。质心系中的动能是什么？）


In center of mass system.It's equal to summation of one-half M I V I squared in the center of mass system. That's equal to one-half summation M I omega cross R I in the center of mass system. Or I write it as one-half summation M I omega cross R I dot omega cross R I. Now, let's call this A. Call this B. Call this whole thing C. It's A cross B dot C. So I can cyclically permute it by a theorem that we had before.And that's equal to summation of M I. A cross B dot C is equal to B cross C dot A. So it's equal to R I cross omega cross R I dot omega. （在质心系中，它等于质心系中各质点质量乘以速度平方的一半之和。这相当于质心系中各质点质量乘以角速度叉乘位置矢量的一半之和。或者我将其写成各质点质量乘以角速度叉乘位置矢量点积角速度叉乘位置矢量的一半之和。现在，我们称这部分为A，这部分为B，整个表达式为C。这是A叉乘B点积C。根据我们之前学过的一个定理，我可以对其进行循环置换。这等于各质点质量乘以位置矢量叉乘角速度叉乘位置矢量点积角速度的总和。因为A叉乘B点积C等于B叉乘C点积A，所以表达式可转化为位置矢量叉乘角速度叉乘位置矢量点积角速度的形式。）


So that's equal to one-half summation M I of R I squared omega by another theorem. Minus R dot omega.R dot omega. It's equal to one-half summation M I R I squared omega minus. Sorry.So I can write this in the following fashion as the one-half summation of omega. Let's see what I'm doing here. First, R I squared omega squared.I write it in this fashion. This is a row matrix. This is a column matrix.This R I squared is a diagonal matrix. All elements of which are R I squared. （所以这等于根据另一个定理得出的1/2乘以M_I乘以R_I的平方乘以ω，再减去R点乘ω。R点乘ω。这等于1/2乘以M_I乘以R_I的平方乘以ω减去...抱歉。我可以这样写：1/2乘以ω的和。让我看看我在做什么。首先，R_I的平方乘以ω的平方。我这样写。这是一个行矩阵。这是一个列矩阵。这个R_I的平方是一个对角矩阵，其所有元素都是R_I的平方。）



And that evidence is equal to R I squared times omega squared.Here this I write in this form. Omega dot R is this expression. So its square is like this.But because of associative law, I can write this as a matrix. So. So the net result is that this is equal to one-half summation omega I of omega.I take out the omega and this big thing is this where this thing is equal to R I squared times the unit matrix minus the column matrix R. But that is exactly a J. So therefore this becomes omega J one-half of omega J omega. J is the moment of inertia matrix. （证据等于RI的平方乘以ω的平方。这里我写成这种形式。ω点R就是这个表达式。所以它的平方是这样的。但由于结合律，我可以把它写成矩阵的形式。因此，最终结果就是这等于1/2乘以ω的I对ω的求和。我把ω提出来，这个大东西就是这个，其中这个东西等于RI的平方乘以单位矩阵减去列矩阵R。但这正好是一个J。因此，这就变成了ωJ乘以1/2的ωJω。J是惯性矩矩阵。）


If I in particular take the moment.If we take the X, Y, Z axis to be the principal axis, to be the principal axis of inertia around center of mass. Then J is diagonal. So then the kinetic energy in the center of mass system is equal to one-half omega J omega, which is equal to one half I one omega one squared, because this is equal to one half omega one omega two omega three times I one I two I three omega one omega two omega three.So therefore it's equal to plus I two omega two squared plus I three omega three squared. （如果我特别抓住这一时刻。如果我们把X、Y、Z轴作为主轴，作为围绕质心的惯性主轴。那么J就是对角矩阵。因此，在质心系中的动能等于二分之一ωJω，这等于二分之一I₁ω₁²，因为这等于二分之一ω₁ω₂ω₃乘以I₁I₂I₃ω₁ω₂ω₃。因此，它等于加上I₂ω₂²加上I₃ω₃²。）

This expression is an old friend. We had the same just earlier today.But now we know that it has a math. At that time it was a mathematical quantity, which we obtained by integration. But now we know that it has a physical meaning.It is in fact the kinetic energy in the center of mass system. So for rotation, I one I two I three play the role of the mass. Omega one omega two omega three play the role of V one V two V three.But the mass for the three directions are the same. But for rotation, I one I two I three may not be the same. So it is much more complicated.（这个表达式是个老朋友了。我们今天早些时候还见过相同的式子。但现在我们知道它蕴含着数学原理。当时它是一个通过积分得到的数学量。但现在我们明白了它具有物理意义——实际上就是质心系中的动能。对于转动而言，I₁、I₂、I₃相当于平动中的质量，ω₁、ω₂、ω₃则对应着v₁、v₂、v₃。不过平动时三个方向的质量相同，而转动中的I₁、I₂、I₃可能各不相同，这就使得情况复杂得多。）

Let's work on some examples. Suppose I have a slope with a cylinder which rolls down. Now let's not necessarily have a cylinder.It's a cylindrical symmetrical body. It could be a cylinder. It could be a coke bottle.A coke bottle is cylindrical, but it has a narrow waist. So cylindrical body rolling down. Suppose it has gone down a distance of H. Let's write down the is rolling down is no friction.（让我们来看几个例子。假设有一个斜面，上面有一个圆柱体滚下来。现在不一定是圆柱体，而是一个具有圆柱对称性的物体。它可能是一个圆柱体，也可能是一个可乐瓶。可乐瓶是圆柱形的，但中间有收腰。所以这个圆柱形物体滚下来。假设它已经滚下了一段距离H。我们写下这个物体在无摩擦的情况下滚动的条件。）

Or rather it's a friction so that there is no heat generated by friction. It's just rolling down. In that case, we can have conservation energy.So the initial energy, we take this to be the base. We take the final position to be the base. So the kinetic, the potential energy is MGH initially.The kinetic energy is zero. So that's the total potential plus kinetic energy initially. What is the final? The final potential energy is zero.The kinetic energy is equal to one half M V squared. （或者说，这是一种摩擦，使得摩擦不会产生热量。它只是向下滚动。在这种情况下，我们可以有能量守恒。初始能量，我们以此为基础。我们将最终位置作为基准。因此，初始的势能是MGH，动能为零。这就是初始的总势能加动能。最终呢？最终的势能为零，动能等于二分之一MV平方。）


We use the theorem we just had proven. The total kinetic energy is equal to the center of mass kinetic energy.This V is the V equal to V center of mass. Plus the rotation energy is one half of... Now it's cylindrically symmetrical and omega... There's only one omega along this direction. Let's call that direction omega one.So it has I one omega one squared. No omega two, no omega three. （我们运用刚才证明的定理。总动能等于质心动能。这里的V就是质心速度V。再加上转动能，即二分之一乘以……由于系统呈圆柱对称，角速度……沿这个方向只有一个角速度分量。我们把这个方向的角速度称为ω₁。因此转动能表达式为I₁ω₁²。不存在ω₂和ω₃分量。）


It's just a simple rotation.But there's a relationship between the velocity and the omega. Velocity is omega times... The radius is called R. If it does not slip, then omega has to be equal to this. So we get MGH is equal to one half M V squared plus one half I. Let's just call I. We write that as I. Omega squared is equal to V squared divided by R squared, which is equal to one half M V squared times one plus I over M R squared, which says V squared is equal to two GH divided by one plus... Now in all such problems, if you think about it for a few minutes, you would immediately realize that the force along the direction of motion is a constant.So it is a constant acceleration. （这只是一个简单的旋转。但速度和角速度之间存在关系。速度等于角速度乘以……半径称为R。如果不打滑，那么角速度必须等于这个值。于是我们得到MGH等于二分之一MV平方加上二分之一I。我们就称之为I。我们把它写成I。角速度的平方等于V平方除以R平方，等于二分之一MV平方乘以（1加I除以MR平方），也就是说V平方等于2GH除以（1加……）。现在，在所有这类问题中，如果你思考几分钟，就会立刻意识到沿运动方向的力是恒定的。所以这是一个匀加速运动。）

For a constant acceleration motion, we have the formula that b squared is equal to two times acceleration times the distance. We have used that repeatedly. Suppose this angle is theta.So this distance is d. So d sine theta is equal to h. d sine theta is equal to h. So I substitute that in. I get a is equal to v squared over 2d is equal to g sine theta. This formula is in the book.It's the equation 12-10. Now what is the I over r squared? （对于一个匀加速运动，我们有一个公式：b的平方等于两倍的加速度乘以距离。我们反复使用了这个公式。假设这个角度是θ。那么这个距离就是d。所以d乘以sinθ等于h。d乘以sinθ等于h。因此，我将其代入。我得到a等于v的平方除以2d等于g乘以sinθ。这个公式在书里。它是方程12-10。那么I除以r的平方是什么呢？）


If it is a ring, we are now analyzing the body. If the body is just a thin ring, then every angle of the moment of inertia is equal to some of M times the distance squared.So therefore it's equal to it's equal to one for ring for scenery. It's equal to one half for uniform cylinder, circular cylinder. And it's equal to five, two thirds, two fifths for sphere, for uniform sphere.For the same radius. Why is the moment of inertia larger for for a ring? This is a ring. This is the first case.The second one is one. The second one is a uniform cylinder. （如果是一个圆环，我们现在分析它的主体。如果主体只是一个薄环，那么每个角度的转动惯量都等于质量M乘以距离的平方。因此，对于圆环来说，转动惯量等于1；对于均匀圆柱体来说，等于1/2；对于均匀球体来说，等于2/5（相同半径情况下）。为什么圆环的转动惯量更大？这是第一种情况（圆环）。第二种情况是均匀圆柱体。）


So it's like this.This one is only one half. If these two bodies have the same mass and have the same radius, this one has twice the moment of inertia than this one. That's very obvious because the total mass of this is the same as the mass here.So you can make the ring by taking this and expel all the mass inside onto the surface. So this can become this by moving everybody out. If you move something out, it's distance from the axis becomes larger.So therefore you increase the moment of inertia. （事情是这样的。这个只有一半。如果这两个物体的质量和半径相同，这个的转动惯量是那个的两倍。这很明显，因为它们的总质量相同。你可以把这个物体内部的物质全部移到表面，就变成了那个环状物体。通过把所有物质向外移动，这个可以变成那个。当你把物质往外移时，它到转轴的距离就变大了，因此转动惯量就增加了。）


So that's why it's not strange that this has twice the angular, the moment of inertia as this. Now we especially talk about the case of a rigid body around a fixed axis.The accent is on the word fixed axis. Not necessarily through the center of mass. Not necessarily a principal axis of inertia.In the last few times we were concentrating on a general motion. Here we talk about a special case of a motion around some axis that axis can be any axis. Not necessarily through the center of mass.If it goes through the center of mass, not necessarily a principal axis of inertia. （这就是为什么这个物体的转动惯量是那个的两倍并不奇怪。现在我们特别讨论的是刚体绕固定轴转动的情况。重点在于“固定轴”这个词。这个轴不一定通过质心，也不一定是惯量主轴。前几次我们集中讨论了一般运动。这里我们讨论的是绕某个轴运动的特殊情况，这个轴可以是任何轴，不一定通过质心。即使它通过质心，也不一定是惯量主轴。）



But because it's fixed, so there are some simplicities. And that's why we discussed it.We take origin O to be a point on the axis, on this fixed axis. Usually we take the origin to be the center of mass, but in this case it's more convenient to take it to be on this fixed axis. So you have a certain body, complicated body, and there's an axis.This axis is fixed. It's externally fixed. Now the first point that we discussed before, when we talk about the torque along this axis, this fixed axis has contribution only from external forces.Need not consider forces due to the axis, due to the axle. It's a complicated body. This is the fixed axis.（但由于它是固定的，所以存在一些简化之处。这就是我们讨论它的原因。我们将原点O取为轴上的一个点，即这个固定轴上。通常我们会将原点取为质心，但在这种情况下，取在固定轴上更为方便。因此，你有一个特定的物体，一个复杂的物体，并且有一个轴。这个轴是固定的，由外部固定。我们之前讨论的第一点是，当我们谈论沿这个轴的扭矩时，这个固定轴的扭矩仅由外力贡献。不需要考虑由轴或轴颈产生的力。这是一个复杂的物体。这就是固定轴。）

We had proven this fixed axis, of course, exerts force on the body. But when we consider the torque along the z-axis, we need not consider them. This is a theorem that we had proven before, so don't forget that.Now let us calculate Lz dot. Now Lz is equal to summation mi. Because it's a z-component, so it's k dot r cross.What is the definition of the angular momentum? Definition of angular momentum is summation for m times r cross v. But the r cross v is equal to this. And we want the z-component, so it's this. Now consider a point.This is the z-axis. This is the origin.（当然，我们已经证明了这个固定轴会对物体施加力。但当我们考虑沿z轴的扭矩时，就不需要考虑这些力了。这是我们之前证明过的一个定理，所以别忘了这一点。现在让我们计算Lz点。现在Lz等于mi的总和。因为它是z分量，所以是k点r叉乘。角动量的定义是什么？角动量的定义是m乘以r叉乘v的总和。但r叉乘v等于这个。而我们想要的是z分量，所以就是这个。现在考虑一个点。这是z轴。这是原点。）


Consider a point, ri.ri refers to the origin, and the origin is not the center of mass. We don't discuss center of mass at all. We only talk about the origin on the axis.That's what we said before. So this is ri, and ri consists of two parts. We can write it as rho i, consider eta i. We write ri is equal to rho i plus eta i. Where eta i is along the axis, rho i is perpendicular to the axis.So this is the axis, and we have a point, and the rho i is the direct perpendicular to the axis, and eta i is that. （考虑一个点，ri。ri指的是原点，而原点并非质心。我们完全不讨论质心。我们只谈论轴上的原点。这是我们之前所说的。因此，这是ri，而ri由两部分组成。我们可以将其写成ρi，考虑ηi。我们写ri等于ρi加上ηi。其中ηi沿着轴线，ρi垂直于轴线。所以这是轴线，我们有一个点，ρi是垂直于轴线的直接距离，而ηi则是沿着轴线的分量。）

So therefore, after you write it this way, it becomes the summation, m i k dot, r is rho plus eta, cross omega, cross rho plus eta. We write this as A, write this as B, write this as C. Actually, let me backtrack.In order to make it simpler, this is equal to summation. I call this A, this B, this C. So then it becomes summation, m i of C, omega cross ri, dot A cross B. This is C, A, B. Now, omega cross ri, ri consists of a rho part and an eta part. The eta part is parallel to omega, so that term, when you cross product two parallel vectors, you get zero.（因此，当你这样写完后，它就变成了求和式，m_i k点，r等于ρ加η，叉乘ω，叉乘ρ加η。我们把这一部分记为A，这部分记为B，这部分记为C。其实，让我重新梳理一下。为了简化表达，这等于求和式。我把这部分称为A，这部分为B，这部分为C。于是它就变成了求和式，m_i乘以C，ω叉乘r_i，点乘A叉乘B。这是C、A、B。现在，ω叉乘r_i，r_i由ρ部分和η部分组成。η部分与ω平行，所以这一项当你对两个平行向量进行叉乘时，结果为零。）


So therefore, you can forget about, so this becomes omega cross rho i. Now, k cross ri, k is along the z-axis. Ri has a rho, r has a rho part and an eta part. The eta part is parallel to k, so you can drop that.So therefore, it becomes k cross rho i. In other words, you don't have to deal with eta i at all. You only talk about the vector distance between ri, between the point in question and the axis, the perpendicular distance rho. （因此，你可以忽略这一点，所以这就变成了ω乘以ρi。现在，k乘以ri，k是沿着z轴的。Ri有一个ρ分量和一个η分量。η分量与k平行，所以你可以忽略它。因此，它变成了k乘以ρi。换句话说，你根本不需要处理ηi。你只需要讨论ri之间的向量距离，即所讨论的点与轴之间的距离，也就是垂直距离ρ。）


Only rho is of any importance.But that is, of course, nothing but m i times summation rho i squared times omega. So it's i omega, where i is equal to summation m i rho i squared. So for this case, for a fixed axis, you can also define a moment of inertia.This moment of inertia is similar, but the concept is different from what we did before. It's a scalar, and it's equal to m i times the perpendicular distance to the axis squared. And we have r is equal to i omega.And so i omega dot is equal to torque, external torque, along z-axis. （只有ρ才是真正重要的。但这当然不过是mi乘以ρi平方的总和再乘以ω。所以就是iω，其中i等于miρi平方的总和。因此，在这种情况下，对于固定轴，你也可以定义一个转动惯量。这个转动惯量类似，但概念与我们之前所做的不同。它是一个标量，等于mi乘以到轴的垂直距离的平方。我们有r等于iω。因此iω点等于沿z轴的外力矩。）

The book talks about the parallel axis theorem. It's on page 227.If you have a body, here's an axis, here's another axis. Consider two parallel axes. This is the center of mass.Z-axis is through center of mass. Z prime axis is parallel to z at a distance h. Now we want to calculate the i around the z prime. That's equal to summation m i. So if this is o, this is the root of the z prime.Let's call this one o prime. This distance is h. And they have a point here, and let's call this r. So we have r prime. r prime is the r relative to the, maybe we should call it the rho, sorry.（这本书讲的是平行轴定理。在第227页。如果你有一个物体，这里有一个轴，这里有另一个轴。考虑两个平行的轴。这是质心。Z轴穿过质心。Z'轴与z平行，距离为h。现在我们想计算围绕z'的i。这等于m i的总和。所以如果这是o，这是z'的根。让我们称这个为o'。这个距离是h。他们在这里有一个点，让我们称这个为r。所以我们有r'。r'是相对于...的r，也许我们应该称它为rho，抱歉。）

For our definition, this I call rho. So rho prime is equal to h plus rho. Rho is the perpendicular distance to the center of mass z-axis.Rho prime is the one relative to z prime axis. So this is equal to rho prime i squared. Which is equal to summation m i h plus rho i squared.Which is equal to summation m i h squared plus 2 sum m i h dot rho i plus sum of m i rho i squared. So this is i, I call it z prime. But this is i around z by definition.This is equal to sum of m, the total mass times h squared. What about this one? （根据我们的定义，这个我称之为ρ。因此ρ'等于h加上ρ。ρ是到质心z轴的垂直距离。ρ'则是相对于z'轴的距离。所以这等于ρ'i的平方。即等于∑mi(h+ρi)²。展开后等于∑mi h² + 2∑mi h·ρi + ∑mi ρi²。这个i，我称之为z'。但根据定义，这个i是围绕z轴的。这等于总质量M乘以h²。那这一项呢？）


This one is zero because h is a constant. It becomes summation m i rho i because the origin, because the z-axis goes through the center of mass.So by the definition of center of mass, this is zero. So we get total mass times h squared. That is called the parallel axis theorem.For example, if you have a circular cylinder, the moment of inertia around the axis is one half m i squared. （这个值为零，因为h是一个常数。由于原点（即z轴穿过质心），它变成了∑mᵢρᵢ。根据质心的定义，这个值为零。所以我们得到总质量乘以h的平方。这就是所谓的平行轴定理。例如，对于一个圆柱体，绕其轴线的转动惯量为(1/2)mr²。）


But if you fix, that means the moment of inertia around this point, if you now have the fixed axis in here, then it's equal to this plus mass times r squared. So it's three halves.Now we talk about the kinetic energy of rigid body rotating around a fixed axis. This is trivial if you just calculate it, because every point has a velocity which is omega cross r. So you can easily prove that the kinetic energy is equal to one half of r. The details you can figure out. （但如果你固定它，就意味着绕这一点的转动惯量——如果你现在把固定轴放在这里——就等于这个加上质量乘以r的平方。所以结果是3/2。现在我们讨论刚体绕固定轴旋转的动能。如果你直接计算的话，这很简单，因为每个点都有一个速度，即ω叉乘r。所以你可以轻松证明动能等于1/2r。具体细节你可以自己推导。）


OK.We have maybe 20 more minutes. I told you that in next week's, next Monday's quiz or midterm, there will be no questions which are not in the book. So that's easier for you.So what we have been discussing in the last two times, most of it will not be covered by the exam. But part of it is, for example, the parallel axis theorem is there. And so you have to decide.（好的。我们大概还有20分钟的时间。我告诉过你们，在下周、也就是下周一的小测验或期中考试中，不会出现书本以外的题目。这对你们来说更容易了。所以我们前两次讨论的大部分内容都不会出现在考试中。但其中有一部分会考，比如平行轴定理就在考试范围内。所以你们得自己权衡。）

You have to look at the book. In the next 20 minutes, I'll answer questions. But if anybody has any questions, which is first, let's talk about questions related to what might become a question in the examination.Anybody has anything which might become a question in the examination? Raise your hand. So everybody is very happy. OK.（你必须看书。接下来的20分钟，我会回答问题。但如果有任何问题，首先是关于可能成为考试题目的问题。有没有人有可能会成为考试题目的问题？举手。看来大家都很高兴。好的。）

Now, any question you can now ask questions not related to problems, to things covered by the book. By the way, you will be given the choice of answering either in English or in Chinese or in a mixture. But the questions will all be written in English.So some. No, quite. Some people do not like questions in English.OK. If a question is a little bit. If a question has unusual English words, we'll give a Chinese translation of it.But most of the questions would be phrased in very easy to understand English. So I'm sure you have no problem.（现在，你可以提出任何问题，不限于书中所涉及的内容。顺便说一下，你可以选择用英语、中文或中英混合回答。但所有问题都将以英文书写。有些人不太喜欢用英文提问。如果问题中有一些不常见的英文词汇，我们会提供中文翻译。不过大多数问题都会用非常容易理解的英文表达，所以我相信这对你来说不是问题。）


I also want to give you a few tricks about taking examinations.If there are numbers, it is best to first have the form. I told you this once. To first have it in formula and only in the end do the calculation.Because if you don't do that, you sometimes make mistakes of computation. And it becomes very difficult for us to disentangle where your question, where your problems or your mistakes started. （我还想给你一些关于考试的技巧。如果有数字，最好先列出公式。我之前告诉过你这一点。要先列出公式，最后才进行计算。因为如果不这样做，有时会犯计算错误。这样我们就很难理清你的问题、困难或错误是从哪里开始的。）


And in any case, if your formula is correct, but the final result, the numerical result is not correct, you would get quite a bit of credit anyway.The other thing is that I would advise you to have some scratch paper. 一些稿纸. 你这个乱七八糟的东西你就放在稿纸上。 不要把乱七八糟的东西放在你的final paper上。 Because if you give me 一个考卷,是10 pages, I would immediately have an inclination to give it a very low mark.It's best to have a neat paper. How do you have a neat paper? （无论如何，如果你的公式是正确的，但最终结果——数值结果不正确，你仍然会得到相当多的分数。另外，我建议你准备一些草稿纸。把那些乱七八糟的东西写在草稿纸上。不要把这些乱七八糟的东西放在你的最终答卷上。因为如果你给我一份10页的考卷，我立刻会有给它打很低分的倾向。最好有一份整洁的答卷。怎样才能有一份整洁的答卷呢？）


You have some scratch paper on the side. You do those things there and then copy the essence onto the paper that you are going to present.This is a trick about how to get good grades. Also, if you have an important result, put it in a box so that it's very clear that that is the final result. Write clearly.What else can I tell you? You know that in 科举时代, the handwriting counts in the final grading. （你可以在旁边放些草稿纸。先在那里做这些事，然后把精华部分誊抄到要提交的纸上。这是拿高分的诀窍。另外，如果有重要结论，就用方框框起来，这样能清晰表明那是最终结果。字迹要工整。还有什么要提醒你的呢？要知道在科举时代，书法水平会影响最终评分。）

Of course, today we don't do that. But nevertheless, a neat paper clearly has an advantage over a messy paper.So remember that. If there are numerical numbers, remember the significant figures statement. So if you get the significant figure very wrong, you'll get some negative points.What else? In review, the book in each chapter has a section which is a review. If you read those reviews very carefully, you have more or less understood the respective chapters. Okay, if you have no questions, goodbye and good luck.（当然，今天我们不再那样做了。但尽管如此，整洁的论文显然比杂乱无章的论文更有优势。所以请记住这一点。如果有数字，记得注意有效数字的说明。如果你在有效数字上犯了大错，会被扣分。还有什么？复习时，书中每一章都有一个复习部分。如果你仔细阅读这些复习内容，就大致掌握了相应的章节。好了，如果没有问题，祝你们好运，再见。）







We had talked about the gyroscope. If it has an angular momentum of L, this is the z-axis. It has an angle of theta.There were several, I said, where we had analyzed how it moves. The question was, it can precess around the z-axis. It's at the top which precesses around the z-axis.The motion which goes around this way is called nutation. Nutation means that it's not stable. It's not a smooth operation.It goes around that circle, like in the diagram that I showed you of Feynman, in Feynman's book. （我们之前讨论过陀螺仪。如果它具有角动量L，这是z轴。它与z轴有一个θ角。我说过，我们已经分析过几种情况下它是如何运动的。问题是，它可以绕z轴进动。它在顶部绕z轴进动。这种绕行的运动称为章动。章动意味着它不稳定。这不是一个平稳的运动。它绕着那个圆圈运动，就像我在费曼书中给你们看的费曼图所示。）


Several students came to me and said that there is a motion which is smoothly just going around without the nutation. I didn't believe that, but I went back and went through a complicated analysis.They were right. It's possible to have that motion. And the final formula is like this.mg is the weight of this body. This rod is supposed to be weightless. The length of the rod is supposed to be L. Theta is this angle.Theta can be 90 degrees, but it can be bigger or smaller than 90 degrees. （几位学生来找我，说有一种运动方式可以让物体平稳旋转而不产生章动。起初我并不相信，但经过一番复杂的分析后，发现他们是对的——这种运动确实存在。最终的公式是这样的：mg代表物体的重量，假设这根杆子没有重量，杆长为L，θ代表这个角度。θ可以是90度，也可以大于或小于90度。）


Omega is the angular velocity around the z-axis, if it goes smoothly. I2, this top, this gyroscope has an I1, which is the main one.But it has three angular momenta. It has three principal axes of inertia. And one of them is I1, the other two are I2 and I3, which are supposed to be the same.Then it can have this formula. If cosine theta is zero, namely if theta is 90 degrees, this becomes exactly the formula that I had derived in class. But at that time, I thought that that's only an approximation.For theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation. （如果运转平稳，Omega就是绕z轴的角速度。I2，这个陀螺，这个回转仪有一个I1，这是主要的。但它有三个角动量。它有三个主惯性轴。其中一个是I1，另外两个是I2和I3，它们应该是相同的。那么它就可以有这个公式。如果cosθ为零，也就是说如果θ为90度，这就完全变成了我在课堂上推导出的公式。但当时我以为那只是一个近似值。对于θ等于零的情况，我以为那是一个近似值。）


Even for theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation. But after a careful analysis, it's not an approximation.For theta equal to zero, it was exact. Next, we discuss on a rigid body. If there is a complicated rigid body, it has a center of mass.Now every part of the body is attracted by gravity. This is the real situation. Every part of the body is subject to gravity, depending on the density.If there is a particularly heavy part of that body, then the gravity here is higher. （即便θ等于零时，我也以为这是个近似值。但经过仔细分析后发现并非近似——当θ为零时，结果是精确值。接下来我们讨论刚体问题。对于一个复杂刚体而言，它必然存在质心。此时物体每个部分都受到重力作用，这才是实际情况。根据密度差异，物体各部位承受的重力各不相同。若某部分质量特别集中，该处受到的重力就会更强。）


We now want to prove a theorem that the total effect of all these gravitational forces on different parts of the body is equivalent to one force acting only on one point, the center of mass, and with a magnitude proportional to the total mass of the body. So let me see a theorem.The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude sum of mg on the center of mass. The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude summation of m times g on the center of mass. This is true for a static situation or a dynamic situation.Static situation, if it's at rest. （我们现在要证明一个定理：所有这些重力对身体不同部分的总效应，等同于一个仅作用于一个点的单一力，这个点就是质心，其大小与身体的总质量成正比。让我来看一下这个定理。重力对刚体的总效应等同于一个作用于质心的单一力，其大小为mg的总和。重力对刚体的总效应等同于一个作用于质心的单一力，其大小为m乘以g的总和。这个定理在静态或动态情况下都成立。静态情况指的是物体处于静止状态。）


For a dynamic situation, if it's moving. For either case, these two cases are equivalent.And this requires a proof. We had proven that the motion of the center of mass, the acceleration of the center of mass, is equal to the total external force. We can write down the total external force as... The total external force consists of two kinds.Gravitational force and non-gravitational force. So I separate and write this. This is the gravitational force on the i-th particle.This is all the other forces on the i-th particle. So I separate the gravitational force from the non-gravitational force. And we also have the equation of d dt.What is in the bracket is the total angular momentum. The time derivative of the total angular momentum is equal to summation of r i cross F i external. And we now separate that into two parts.Summation of r i cross F i g plus summation of r i cross F i other. In other words, we separate the gravitational effect from the non-gravitational effect. These are the gravitational effect.What we now want to prove is that this gravitational effect is equivalent to the case where there is only one force acting on one point, the center of mass. But F i g, the gravitational force on the m-th particle, is equal to minus. Suppose k is the unit vector on the z-axis upwards.So it's m i g times k. The gravitational force on the i-th body is obviously equal to this. So summation of F i g is equal to minus summation of m d k. Which is equal to total force on center of gravity. So this part is the gravitation.We have proven for this part that the action on the whole body is equivalent to the action on the center of mass. How about this part? Summation F i g is equal to m g m k. So that is equal to r i. But summation of m i r i is equal to summation of m times r center of mass. This torque.This torque is equal to, let's write the torque. This is the torque due to gravity. It's equal to minus g summation of m r center of mass cross k. And that is equal to torque on center of mass by one force.So QED. Because we have proven that this term for the motion, dynamic or static, is equivalent to the action of one force. And this is also equal to the action of one force.So what's the conclusion? The conclusion is that when you talk about the gravitational force on a complicated rigid body, you can replace the total effect by just one force on the center of mass. As a matter of fact, that center of mass may not be a part of the body. You can think of a ring.The center of mass is here. It's not a part of the body. But the total gravitational effect on the spring is equivalent to a force of this.You can imagine that this is connected to it by a massless rigid rod. However, what we have proven is dependent on the fact that every point is attracted by Earth, with a magnitude of m times g. And it's always the same g. If it's a big body, this is not correct. If this is Earth.If I think of daily life, that statement that every particle is attracted in a minus z direction with mg is correct. But if this is the Earth and you have a big body, like a mountain, then the force here and the force here are not even in the same direction. As a consequence, the theorem that we just had proven is true only for small bodies.As a matter of fact, I can easily construct a case where you have a collection of forces on a body. And that collection cannot be replaced by one force. What we have proven in the last sheet is that the collective forces, gravitational forces, if it's a small body, is replaceable by one force.But in general, it is not true that if I have a collection of forces. If I have one force, which goes this way, another force, which... I only need two forces. If these two forces intersect, then you can replace these two forces by one force, which is the sum of the two.If those two forces do not intersect, for example, if one goes this way, the other one goes this way, then it is not possible to replace it by a force. You can take the sum, but the torque would not be correct. So in general, a big body like this case, the total effect of the gravitational force on that big body, not only is not replaced by that formula, in general, it cannot be replaced by a single force.It has to be replaced by a more complicated... Can anybody tell me, if I say that okay, if I have a complicated collection of forces, I said it may not be replaceable by a single force. Could somebody tell me whether it can be replaced by somewhat more complicated arrangement? It can be replaced by two things. A, the total force, you just add all the forces like what we have, but the components may not be parallel to each other.And B, plus a torque. A torque is just, you can think of two equal and opposite forces, this way and this way, that generates a torque. Theorem, any collection of forces acting on a rigid body, a complicated rigid body, can be replaced by one force on the center of mass, plus one torque.But we are not going to use this theorem, so I just state it. If you are interested, you can think about it. It's actually not difficult to prove.There is a concept called center of gravity. Center of gravity is not the same as the center of mass. Center of mass only depends on m. It doesn't have anything to do with any forces on it.But center of gravity, if you want a definition like this, is that you try to pick a point where one force acts on it, and the effect of that is equivalent to the total gravitational force. That, in general, does not exist. Center of gravity is the center of mass.If the body is small, center of gravity for a large body does not exist, because the collection of gravitational forces on a large body cannot be replaced by a single force acting at a single point. Now we are going to do one of the problems of the book. It's page 291, 24p.It's a series of four blocks of the same length, each of them uniform, and you put them at the edge of the table. And the question is, you try to make them as far away from the table as possible. So this is called A1, A2, A3, A4.You want to make each of them as large as possible. The question is, if the total length is L, what are the values of A1, A2, A3, A4? Well, first, in order to make this problem simple, let us choose L to be equal to 4. That makes it easier to think. So let's first analyze the top block.I think everybody would agree that the top block is such that A1 is equal to 2. Because if this third block is already stable there, you put the fourth on. And clearly, if you make it just halfway going out, it's just balanced. So we say A1 is equal to 4. A is equal to 2. Then let us consider A1 and A2.Consider the top two blocks together. The center of mass of these two top two blocks is here. Agree? It's symmetrical.So if I put that, if I put the next block here, the top two blocks won't fall. That proves that A1, A2, A2 is equal to 1. Then we consider the center of mass of the top three blocks and put the next one here. In other words, what we have just done is the following.To determine this point, this point should be at the center of mass of the first block. This point should be at the center of mass of the top two blocks. This point should be at the center of mass of the top three blocks.Is everybody happy with what I just said? Okay. So in order to do this systematically, let's take this point to be the origin and call this distance, call this distance X1. X1 is the center of, the position of the center of mass, always referring to this point, of the top block.This we call X2. X2 is the position, is the X coordinate of the center of mass of the top two blocks. And this one we call X3.X3 is the position of the top three blocks. So we know X1 is equal to 2. How about the X2? X2 here is the center of mass, is the position of the center of mass of the top two blocks. By definition, 2X2, we assume each block to weigh exactly one.So the top two, that should be equal to MIXI summed. So MIXI summed is equal to X1 plus X1 plus 2. I'm now talking about, I'm calculating this point. So this is the center of mass of the top two blocks.So this is sum of M times the X of the center of mass of the top two blocks, is equal to M1X1 plus M2X2. All M's are equal to one, so it's equal to X1, the position of the center of mass of the first block, that's X1. The position of the center of mass of the second block is X1 plus 2, because you have moved by 2. So I get 2X2 minus X1 is equal to 2. So X2 minus X1 is equal to 1. So I have X2 is equal to 2.

Now I do the same for the next one. The next one I have the x3. x3 is the position of the center of mass of the top three blocks.So I get 3x3. I am now writing a summation mi xi is equal to sum of m times x of center of mass. So sum of m is 3 because I have three blocks on top.This is the position of the center of mass. And that's equal to... We had proven a theorem earlier that if you have a collection of particles, you divide it into two groups, then the center of mass of the whole thing is equal to the center of mass of two particles. What is the center of mass of this group? You think of this group to be concentrated at one point.You think of this group to be concentrated at one point, so that you have only two particles. And then the center of mass of these two imagined particles is equal to the center of mass of the whole thing. We have proven the theorem.So now we use that theorem. So the three blocks, I first do two of them. Two of them I get, of course, 2x2.I get, of course, 2x2 plus the third one. The third one is that x2 plus 2 times 1. So if I do this, I get 3x3 minus x2 is equal to 2. So I get x3 minus x2 is equal to 2 thirds. If you think about this, it's actually 2 seconds.Now, if you do this next, you get x4 minus x3 is equal to 2 fourths. x5 minus x4 is equal to 2 fifths. So successively, these 8s are equal to 2, 1. The next one is 2 thirds.Then it's 2 fourths, 2 fifths. Everybody happy? Anybody unhappy? Okay. Now we get the... So if you have an enormous number of these, what do you get? You get... It's extending.If I want to calculate how far it extends beyond the edge of the table, I get 2. It's actually 2 over 1 plus 2 over 2 plus 2 over 3 plus 2 over 4 plus et cetera is equal to 2 times 1 plus 1 half plus 1 third plus 1 fourth. Who knows what that infinite series is equal to? This is a famous series. It's equal to what? It's equal to infinity.Does anybody know how to prove that? Raise your hand. Who knows? Don't be shy. Yes.To prove why that is infinity. Okay. What this student says is... He considers y. This is x. He considers the curve y equal to 1 over x is a curve like this.And I think what he wants to say is... Let's say this is a number, let's say. The way that I draw it, this has to be maybe 5 over 1. So 5 over x. And this is 5. And 1 is 5. And 2 is 2 and a half. And this is the first area.This is the second area. And that's correct, but that's... How do you know that this area is infinity? Because the area under the graph from x equal to 1 to x equal to infinity is the integration of 5 over x. The x will give you 5 log x. What he says is... It's not incorrect. But it's too complicated.It's much simpler. Can anybody give me a very simple proof that that's infinity? Yes. And Li Zhen said... This is the series.1 plus 1 half plus 1 third plus 1 quarter plus 1 fifth and so on and so forth. Now he wrote another series. Which term by term is smaller than this one.This is 1 half, this is 1 third. He writes 1 quarter, so these two are 1 quarter. These four he writes as 1 eighth.And term by term, this new one is smaller than the old one. But these two together is 1 half, these four together is 1 half. The next eight together is 1 half.So they are infinite number 1 halves. Which is evidently as large as you want. And this is larger than this as large as you want.So it's even larger. So it's infinity. Actually this proof is exactly the same as what that fellow wanted.Only you do it this way. Instead of take this, you take this. So therefore all of this is more complicated.But this way of reasoning goes by doing something like this. And then you need to prove that that sum is bigger than, is as large as possible. You can go through the same argument.What that fellow wanted is a logarithmic, this curve. When you integrate it, it becomes a logarithm. And logarithm of infinity is infinity.So that's another proof. But that proof is a more complicated proof. Li Zheng's proof is the simplest.So in principle, you can make it lean as far as possible. But of course in practice you can never do that. It will fall out if you try it.If you have several books, you easily find that unless you make very accurate blocks, you cannot make it extend very far. Now if we have a static situation, that means no motion. That means all time derivatives are zero.In that case, acceleration is equal to zero. So we have two formulas. One is the sum of Fi external.That of course includes gravity is equal to zero. And sum of Ri cross Fi external. The total torque is equal to zero.For a three-dimensional case, this is three equations, this is three equations. So you have six equations. Let me emphasize that in doing this, you can replace, we have proven that you can replace the gravitational force by a single force.Since we usually talk about in daily life, small objects. And the other one is that you have to be careful. Only include, only include external forces on the body.Not forces by the body on other things. The reason I say this is because I had taught freshman physics in student book. And one of the great confusions in solving this equilibrium problems by the students was that some students got confused about, they include some of the forces exerted by the body on other things.If your problem has several bodies, you have to be careful that you look at each body separately. And look at the forces on that body. And not forces by that body on another body.So remember this line. For a three-dimensional problem, we have three equations here, three equations here, we have six equations. So if the problem starts with the six unknowns, in general you can solve for the six.But there are cases where if there are too many unknowns, then if there are more unknowns for three-dimensional problems than six, then you have a case where you have no unique solution. But you don't have to count it that way. Let's for example take a simple case which is a four-legged stool.If I have a four-legged stool, and the whole body has a weight here, and you are asked to evaluate the four forces on the four legs. The body suffers five forces. One is the gravity in the center, and then the four forces on the four legs.So you have F1, F2, F3, F4. You have F1 plus F2 plus F3 plus F4 is equal to mg. If you take the angular momentum, you get the, suppose this distance is called r. This diagonal distance we call it r. Then let's put this one be F1, this F2, this F3, this F4.Then F1 and F3, I claim F1 minus F3 times r. It's a torque in this direction. And that has to be equal to zero. While F2 minus F4 times r gives you a torque in a perpendicular direction.So that also has to be equal to zero. Does everybody agree with these three formulas? It's a rectangle. So the F1 and F3, one gives a torque this way, the other gives a torque this way.So you have a torque which is in a diagonal direction. F2 and F4 gives a torque in a perpendicular direction. And since the vector has to be equal to zero, so both components have to be equal to zero, so we have these two.In this case, you have only three equations, and you have four unknowns. So therefore, it's indeterminate. In fact, what this equation says is that F1 is equal to F3, F2 is equal to F4.But, for example, I can make F1 equal to... So I can make, for example, F1 equal to F3 equal to one-half of mg, and F2 equal to F4 equal to zero. In other words, the first one and the third one, diametrically opposite, but equal forces, and the other two have no force. Actually, intuitively, you know this is the case.It's the case where only these two touch the ground. If these two do not touch the ground, then these two forces, exactly each of them becomes one-half of mg. But if these two touch the ground and these two do not, then you have the other solution, which is the opposite of this.And you can have any linear combination of them. So if you have a smooth floor, if you put this heavy stool on it, what happens? You know all four of them would have the same weight. In other words, the true solution for a physical situation is each of the forces, F1 to F4, is equal to one-quarter of mg.How do you know? Why do you believe that all four are equal for a real situation? It is because there are other things that you have to consider, and that comes to elasticity. The ground is slightly elastic, and if one leg goes down too much, there will be a tremendous force forcing it upwards. So if it is an elastic thing, so think of a rubber floor, then it will become, then it is, if you want to really analyze this, it won't be that one sinks deeper than another one.The simplest case is all four of them to go down by the same amount, and therefore the reaction's force, F1, F2, F3, F4, will also be identical. So if you want to consider a physical case of an over-determined system, then you have to consider the property of the surface. If the surface is uniform, like a rubber or a soft floor, then of course you would get equal ones.But if the floor is such that two of the legs are on rubber, the other two legs are on a hard floor, you immediately know what happens. The two legs would sink deeper into the rubber, and therefore the thing would tilt, and the forces would not be identical on the four legs. So in that case you need the elasticity.So next we turn to the elasticity question. In the book, it's section 13.6. The book discusses three kinds of stress and strain. First is Young's modulus.If you stretch something, if a cable, you stretch it by delta L. The original length is L. Delta L is the amount you stretch. Then the force is always proportional to the area. If it's a steel cable or a steel rod, if you stretch it, the thicker the rod, of course the larger the force.So it's the force per unit area that's important. Force per unit area is equal to a constant, which is called Young's modulus, times delta L over L. This is called Young's modulus. You should read the table, 13-1.It lists the Young's modulus for steel, for aluminum, for glass, etc., etc. Look at it, you'll see that the larger the Young's modulus, of course the larger the force per unit area. For steel, the Young's modulus is very large.As a consequence, you cannot stretch it very much. It requires tremendous force to stretch it. By the way, this formula also is correct for both plus sign for delta L and minus sign for delta L. If delta L is positive, that means you are stretching it.If delta L is negative, that means you are compressing it. Stretching it and compressing it, if the stretching and the compression are not very large, it follows the same formula. In other words, the same Young's modulus always works for both stretching and compressing.But that's true only for small displacements. If you stretch a steel rod too much, it will break. The precise behavior of a steel rod when you stretch it is an extremely important topic, because if you are an engineer, you have to know what happens.For example, a suspension bridge depends on stretching a cable. And if you stretch the cable too much, it would break, and the bridge would collapse. So therefore, if you study engineering, you would need to know the behavior of steel rods when the stress and the strain become too large.So read that section of the book. It has a diagram which indicates experimentally how, when you stretch too much, the rod would break. Now, does one know, does one understand that curve? To a certain extent.But the fundamental understanding becomes extremely complicated. Why? Because a steel rod is a crystal. Now, you can have a perfect crystal and a non-perfect crystal.And when you stretch it too much, or when you compress it too much, the crystal becomes distorted. But actually, a rod is never a perfect crystal. It has defects.And when you try to stretch it or compress it, these defects rearrange themselves. So that's an extremely complicated subject. And if you study engineering, you'll be dealing with such things.Or rather, it's like this. If you study solid-state physics, you will deal with such things. If you study engineering, you'll also deal with such things, but from different viewpoints.For a physicist, you'll be dealing with, for example, the defects. When you stretch it too much, you would have rearrangement of the defects. And that's a very complicated, very fascinating subject.And there are people who devote their lives to it. If you are an engineering student, you do not care about how precisely it goes inside. But you want to know the phenomena.What kind of steel would have what kind of stress-strain curve? And you base your judgment about how to make cables, or how to make buildings on such a phenomenological curve. So it's the same complicated subject, but viewed from different ways by a physicist and by an engineer. Now, another one is shear modulus.If you have a block with a length of air, instead of stretching it or compressing it, you can shear it by making it move this way. You anchor it. This point is clamped, and instead of compressing it or stretching it, you shear it.And this distance is called delta x. In that case, the force per unit area is again force per unit area is equal to a shearing stress.

Shearing modulus times delta x over L. And the book also talks about the hydraulic stress. That is, if you have, if you put a, say, a rubber ball. If you move that rubber ball deep into a swimming pool, it will be compressed.And if a diver takes that down to very deep depths, it will become much smaller. And if you take a steel ball, it's not going to change very much. But if it's under tremendous pressure, it will still be compressed.And in that case, the pressure is equal to a Burke modulus times change of volume divided by volume. The book talks about these three, but actually the problem is much, much more complicated than this. Because we talk, for example, about the stress and strain.The stress and strain are not just a vector. Take this case. The displacement is in this direction.And the force could be in more than that direction. This is a simplified case. So in general, the stress and strain are both tensors.Tensors are more complicated than vectors. So therefore, the relationship between stress and strain is a very complicated subject. And that itself is a subject which has been dealt with both from the physicist's viewpoint and from the engineering viewpoint.OK, now we are going to leave Chapter 13 and go to Chapter 14. Chapter 14 talks about gravity. The gravitational force between two points is equal to, we usually write a minus, and the gravitational constant times the mass of the first one, mass of the second one, divided by r squared.Where g is equal to 6.67 times 10 to the minus 11th Newton meter squared divided by kilogram squared. Actually, that the gravitational force between two things is inversely proportional distance squared was already guessed at around Newton's time. We, in general, attribute the beginning of modern science to Newton's work called Principia.But of course, Newton was living in an environment in which after the Renaissance in Europe, there were all kinds of intellectual pursuits including, for example, the proof that we just used, that 1 plus 1 half plus 1 third plus 1 quarter and so on and so forth is equal to infinity. But much more complicated formula than that were already known by complicated arguments by many people. So, there was Renaissance.

The Renaissance created a general atmosphere of intellectual pursuit and Newton lived in that atmosphere. But he was, of course, a great genius and we shall see how great a genius he was in a few minutes. He was the one who formulated this formula, but as I said, it has already been guessed at by many people.Now, actually, when he was in his 20s, he already had this formula in his mind, but he did not publish it for 20 years. Why did he not publish it? Because he wanted to understand one thing, and that is, there was already before him Kepler's three laws. I'm sure you have learned about that in high school.And Kepler's law says that if you have a sun here and you have an earth here, then the earth would go around the sun. This is a very bad ellipse. So, Newton wanted to prove this and we are going to prove this later.But Newton realized that the earth is not a point, it's a small sphere. The sun is not a point, it's a big sphere. And if he proposes a gravitational force, it's the gravitational force between every part of the sun and every part of the earth.So, you should not treat the sun as a point and the earth as a point. He first proved that if there were points, then the earth would move in an orbit, which is an ellipse. Which, of course, made him very happy because that's what Kepler had proven experimentally.No, I shouldn't say that. Kepler used experimental data, Kepler analyzed experimental data and found for the first time in the history of mankind that the trajectory of the earth, of Mars, actually he was looking at Mars, was an ellipse and not a circle. That was a great revolution, we'll come to that later.So, Newton knew that. And Newton wanted to show that the big sphere attracting the small sphere gives you the same result as two points attracting each other. And that's the book called the Scher theorem.The Scher theorem, this theorem took Newton 20 years. And after he has completely mastered that point, he wrote his book. Actually, there is another reason.There were people who were telling him that if you don't publish, other people will publish it. So, he rushed into publication that the book is called the Principia. And that's, of course, one of the great events in the history of mankind.Now, what is the Scher theorem? The Scher theorem says that if you have a Scher, if you have a uniform Scher, then if you have a gravitational force by the Scher on a body here, then that gravitational force is equivalent to you compress all the Scher's mass into a single point. And you use the same formula, same gravitational formula of attraction between this center and this point. In other words, the Scher, as far as the gravitational attraction is concerned, can be replaced by a single point.That's called the Scher theorem. Now, let's try to prove that. Suppose this distance is R, this distance is A. A is the distance from the center of the point P. This is the center, point O. And let us now consider a ring at an angle theta.So now we consider this ring. And we will consider instead of the Scher, a part of the Scher, just a ring. Let's call this angle phi.This angle is theta. What is the area of the ring? The circumference of the ring is 2 pi R times sine theta. The ring is a circle.Its diameter, its radius, is R sine theta. So 2 pi R sine theta is the circumference. So the area of that is equal to that circumference times the width of the ring.The width of the ring is R d theta. Agreed? It's like a piece of watermelon skin. This circle is 2 pi R sine theta.The width of the skin is R d theta. The mass of the ring is the traditional area. If the depth of the ring is T, and the density is rho, then multiply that by rho T. Rho is equal to density.T is equal to thickness. This is the mass of the ring. So there are so many things in the mass of the ring.The force is in this direction. So force by ring at feet is equal to rho T times this thing. If the mass of this thing is M, then it turns out GM divided by the distance squared.What is the distance squared? It's R sine theta squared. The distance squared is R sine theta squared plus this squared, which is plus A times R cosine theta squared. But this is not right.Because this is the force. Every force has a component along the axis. So it has to multiply by cosine phi.Does everybody agree with this? But we know what cosine theta is. What is cosine theta? Cosine theta is equal to A minus R cosine phi divided by the radius. The radius is the square root of the denominator.I called that F just now. So F is equal to 2 pi rho T R squared GM times the integral of sine theta d theta times A minus R cosine theta divided by the square root of R square sine square theta plus A minus R cosine theta squared. This is theta times 0 to theta times pi.I'm assigning this as an exercise. In one of the exercises next week, you will be evaluating this integral. And after you have evaluated it, you find it to be this 4 pi rho T R squared GM over A squared.But 4 pi R squared, 4 pi R squared is the surface area of the shell. 4 pi R squared T is the volume. So 4 pi R squared T rho is the mass of the shell.I call this M prime. So this is equal to M prime GM M prime over A squared. Therefore, the force is equivalent to, is equal to the force exerted at the point P by a body at the center with mass equal to M prime.The shell there. So Newton assumed that the sun is a, is a uniform, it only has to be spherically symmetrical. So many shells.And all of these shells can be compressed into one point, attracting the earth. By a reverse application of this theorem, you can also shrink the earth into a point. So therefore, you get the conclusion that you can, you need only think of point motion for talking about such a, for talking about such a dynamic problem.If you look at, I think I told you once, it's clear that that is how he arrived at this. It took him 20 years to develop integral calculus for him to be able to do this. But when he wrote his book, he did not use integral calculus.He used geometrical arguments. I never understood the geometrical argument, but as I told you, Chandrasekhar, a great astrophysicist who died 10 years ago, spent the last 10 years of his life trying to puzzle out what Newton did. And he claimed to have understood the geometrical proof of this shell theorem.So this is the earth. For a man here, the gravitational force has in the denominator the radius of the earth, squared. But if you have a mountain, for a man on top of the mountain, the distance to the center of the earth is larger, and therefore the gravitational attraction is smaller.Actually, there's another added part to it. For a man here, the immediate... If this is a high mountain, like the Himalayas, the person here suffers a force not only by the earth itself, but also by the mountain. So it's very complicated.But the main effect... These two effects are in opposite directions. He's been very high. The distance is larger, so therefore the gravitational attraction is smaller.But because of the mountain, his gravitational attraction is larger. These two are in opposite directions. But the former one is more important.So the gravitational force at this point is in general smaller than the gravitational force on the surface of the earth. You can read that in the book. Now let's ask what is the gravitational force inside the earth.People now can dig a hole into the ground several kilometers. And you can ask, how about the gravitational force inside? All right. Then there is another version of the shear theorem.The shear theorem... Let's see. Did I write down the... I did not write down. Shear theorem.The gravitational force on a particle, on a point, outside a shear, by the shear, is the same as if the shear is compressed into one point at its center. Let me read. The gravitational force on a point outside the shear, by the shear, is the same as if the shear is compressed into one point at its center.There is another part of the shear theorem. You can call it shear theorem A, shear theorem 2, shear theorem B. The gravitational effect force exerted by a shear, by a shear, on a point inside the shear is zero. So, is it? The point P suffers attraction this way, but it also is attracted this way.So, in all directions, it's obvious that the force exerted in the center is zero because it's very symmetrical, so every force is balanced by another force equal and opposite to it. But for a point not in the center, it is not obvious that it's equal to zero. But Newton had proven that it is equal to zero, so it's also called a shear theorem.I will assign that also as an exercise for you. But both shear theorem A and shear theorem B can be very easily proven when you learn electricity. It's a fundamental aspect of electricity, and by more advanced concepts, it becomes—you don't need any integration, you can immediately get the result.That is the power of higher mathematics. In fact, this remarkable phenomenon that from the outside, you can compress it, the effect can be regarded as a compressed point. Inside, there is no force.That crucially is dependent on the inverse square law. For example, you can do the same exercise that we did, but not with 1 over r squared, with 1 over r 2 plus delta. People have studied this.Instead of 1 over r squared, you write as 1 over r 2 plus delta. Then you find that the needle theorem is correct. If delta is not equal to zero, then both the outside and the inside, the results are different, are very complicated.So in many senses, Newton was very lucky, because if nature did not have delta equal to zero, then it becomes much more complicated. He may never find Newton's law. But of course, if delta is not equal to zero, Kevlar's law is also not correct.And if Kevlar's law is not correct, then the whole problem, the thing would go around in very complicated orbits, and there would be no Kevlar's three laws. Then they may never develop the mechanics. Okay, so why was Newton so lucky? Or in many senses, why is mankind so lucky? If you ask this question, you'll find that it's because 1 over r squared law, not only is simple when you write it as 1 over r squared, it's because it follows more general rules, and in those general rules, it has to be delta equal to zero.In other words, we now understand more why it has to be the inverse squared, not the inverse 2 plus delta. But that still does not explain why this more complicated beautiful structure was chosen by nature.

remarkable that nature has successive layers of elegant and beautiful rules which in some sense are made such that it reveals beauty and that is the reason why we could decipher some of this. But you can never answer the last question because if you find an overall structure which explains this 2 plus delta you have to ask the question why this overall structure has infinite items. So I always say that what Newton taught us is that there is science but science cannot explain everything.

If you ask too many questions science cannot answer it. That part belongs to religion because the religious people say that's very simple, God made it. But that answer in fact is very profound.

Profound in the sense that it can always be true. And so in my opinion science and religion are not contradictory. They are after the same thing.

Only as time goes on we understand more. So the territory of science expands and religion retreats. You know that Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Now the Catholic Church has to admit that they were wrong. They should not have persecuted Galileo. So religion is retreating.But religion forever will be bigger than science because it covers everything beyond. And I believe that will remain the case forever. Okay, next time I'm going to give you the results of your examinations.So I hope everybody did well. We had talked about the gyroscope. If it has an angular momentum of L, this is the z-axis.It's at the angle of theta. There were several, I said, well we had analyzed how it moves. The question was it can precess around the z-axis.It's at the top which precesses around the z-axis. The motion which goes around this way is called nutation. Nutation means that it's not stable.

It's not a smooth operation. It goes around that circle. Like in the diagram that I showed you of Feynman, in Feynman's book.Several students came to me and said that there is a motion which is smoothly just going around without the nutation. I didn't believe that. But I went back and went through a complicated analysis.They were right. It's possible to have that motion. And the final formula is like this.mg is the weight of this body. This rod is supposed to be weightless. The length of the rod is supposed to be L. Theta is this angle.Theta can be 90 degrees but it can be bigger or smaller than 90 degrees. Capital omega is the angular velocity around the z-axis if it goes smoothly. I2, this top, this gyroscope has a I1 which is the main one.But it has three angular momenta. It has three principal axes of inertia. And one of them is I1.The other two are I2 and I3 which are supposed to be the same. Then it can have this formula. If cosine theta is zero, then theta is 90 degrees.This becomes exactly the formula that I had derived in class. But at that time I thought that that's only an approximation. For theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation.Even for theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation. But after careful analysis, it's not an approximation. For theta equal to zero, it was exact.Next, we discuss on a rigid body. If there is a complicated rigid body, it has a center of mass. Now every part of the body is attracted by gravity.Actually, this is the real situation. Every part of the body is subject to gravity depending on the density. If there is a particularly heavy part of that body, then the gravity here is higher.We now want to prove a theorem that the total effect of all these gravitational forces on different parts of the body is equivalent to one force acting only on one point, the center of mass, and with a magnitude proportional to the total mass of the body. So let me, theorem. The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude sum of mg on the center of mass.The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude sum of mg on the center of mass. This is true for a static situation. The results of the Qilong test were very good.and perhaps talk to Professor Rang or Professor An about how you could do better later on this semester. It's clear that the average score of Tsinghua students is much better than my students at Stony Brook. So I'm pleased about that.Today's first topic is gravity inside Earth. We talked about the shell theorem last time. That is, if you consider the gravity due to this shell at a point inside the Earth, there is no force on it.Now for the next shell, there's also no force. So that means all the material in the Earth outside of this circle together have no gravity on this point. The gravity on that point is due to all the material inside of that radius.So this gravity at all equal to gravity due to the material inside the sphere of radius R. Now, that material has a mass of is equal to 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. Well, we are assuming a uniform sphere. This is not true, but let us assume it's a uniform sphere.The volume of the sphere is 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. If rho is the density, then that material has a mass of this amount. By the shell theorem, our external points, the gravitational force at O is equal to all that mass being concentrated at the center.So it's equal to minus g times m. So m is the mass at this point times this density, this mass, divided by R cubed, divided by R squared. This is g m, capital M, divided by R squared. And that is, of course, equal to something, something, something times R. A constant times R. So we now have the conclusion.Inside the Earth, the gravitational force is proportional to R. It's equal to zero at the center, obviously, because at the center it's spherically symmetrical. There's no force in any direction. But as you go away from it, the attractive force becomes larger and larger, proportional to R, until you reach this point.关于这一点有没有问题? Now we talk about Section 10-6, Gravitational Potential Energy. 引力的未能,potential energy是未能。 We want to prove that the potential energy is equal to minus g m m. 大m是,小m是,大m是sun,小m是earth. 我们先take one dimension.假如u是这样子的话, 我们从前说这个force是等于 minus du dr. 我们从前说这个,就是 just a second. This is equal to g m m r squared.Let's see, something's wrong. First, there's a minus here, here, there's a minus sign here, and d dr, d dr, get the minus sign. So this is right.所以,假如你u可以这样子的话, 这个force是等于这个,correct. 所以,u等于这是correct. 这是一个one-dimensional problem.How about the three-dimensional? Three-dimensional的话,要用所谓partial differentiation. Three-dimensional的时候, 然后,这个u是等于minus g m m r, 现在是x squared加y squared加z squared. 现在是three-dimensional了。 那么,对于x,y,z,你要differentiate的时候, 叫做partial differentiation, that means, when you differentiate relative to x, you consider y and z as fixed.When you differentiate with respect to y, you consider x and z as fixed. So, this notation叫做force,是一个vector, 是du dx,minus du dx, minus du dy, minus du dz. 这个notation是叫partial differentiation.这里有一个平常的这个叫做gradient, 三角形加一个箭头的意思, 就是三个partial differentiation, partial x, partial y, partial z. OK,我们来试一下。 假如我们take这个的话, 那么,du dx是等于minus g m m, 乘上du d这个square root, 然后,d这个square root,dx。 这就是所谓chain rule, 你在differentiate的时候, 这是minus g m m, 那du d这个东西呢, 这u是1 over r, du d 1 over r, 这个minus 1 over r squared, 所以这个是minus 1 over, d这个square root,dx呢, 是等于二分之一的square root, 二分之一,1 over square root, 乘上d这个square root, d这个square root的inside, 就是x squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 因为这是中间的东西的二分之一, 所以dsquare root of一个something, 是等于二分之一的1 over square root of that thing, 乘上d它里头的,所以就变成这个。 对不起。 这还要乘上dx squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 这个算了一顿以后, 就得出来g m m r squared, 乘上x over r。 所以你这样算出来这个f, 就等于g m m over r squared, 有个负号,因为这有个负号, 乘上x over r,同样y over r,z over r, 它是三个component。 这个间线呢,就变成minus g m m over r squared, 乘上r over r。 这是什么意思呢? 这个是the force, r over r是unit vector along the r direction, 所以比如说是, 这空间有一点, 这个unit vector是r over r, 因为r over r当然是在r direction, 它的magnitude是1, 所以这是unit vector。 那所以这个force是对的。 Correct. In other words, we have proven that u是等于这个。 在three dimension的时候,u也是对的。 这个formula可以记得。 所以这个force是可以写成这样。 Conservation of energy. 我们现在有这个formula, F是等于minus gradient of u, gradient的意思就是d dx,d dy,d dz, 可是我们知道这东西是等于m乘上r double dot, 这是Newton's law, 所以我把它用r dot, dot一下子, 我把它写成minus r dot, dot, 右边这是什么? 右边就等于d dt, of 1 over 2, m, r dot, dot r dot, 你同意不同意? Because if I differentiate this, I can differentiate this one first.

Plus, I differentiate this one. Those terms would give you r dot dot r double dot. So that two cancels this two, so this is this.

And this is d dt of m v squared. That's our old friend, the kinetic energy. But what is the left side? The left side is minus d dr dt dot d dx plus.I write this explicitly, right? This is equal to minus x dot times du dx minus y dot du dy minus z dot du dz. Do you agree or disagree? Because that's what's meant by the dot product. Dot product means you write these three components down.X dot, y dot, z dot. The gradient is d dx, d dy, d dz. But once you have du dx, dx, dx, dt, du dy, dy, dy, this means minus du dt.So we have, so putting these two together, we get d dt of u plus kinetic energy. So u plus one half m v squared is equal to a constant. And that's usually called E total energy.This is, of course, something that we are familiar with. We have been familiar with already about the total conservation of energy. Now the only thing that's new is for the gravitational force.We know explicitly what the conservation, what the energy expression is. Is this U is a minus GMM divide by R. Any questions? I'm going to talk about the escape velocity, neglect air resistance. So if on Earth, you put a rocket with velocity v, of course the rocket has to overcome the resistance of air.But let us neglect that. Let us assume that the satellite or the rocket is already above the Earth's atmosphere. Let's say above 50 kilometers, there is essentially no more atmosphere.Does anybody know how the atmosphere goes down when you go farther and farther away? I'm sure you know that as you go farther and farther away from the Earth, the air pressure becomes less and less. And it's a complicated phenomenon because there is also temperature. There is a temperature variation, but roughly when you go out, you know that the pressure decreases, essentially exponentially.It's about every five kilometers, the pressure becomes half. So if you go very far, there's no more air pressure. So now let us start from that point.If I shoot the rocket at that point out, if it's too slow, it will come down. It will be pulled down by Earth. The question is at what velocity would it escape? Well, if it escapes, that means that because of the conservation of energy, that means that when it reaches infinity, it essentially has no more velocity.So if it escapes, then E equal to minus G M M over R plus one-half M V squared must be greater than zero. Because... Because at R equal to infinity, E... If it can escape, that means that when... There is no square. When it reaches infinity, potential energy is zero.Kinetic energy is positive. Kinetic energy is always positive, so the total energy has to be positive. But at zero, it just barely escapes.That means that if E is equal to zero, that means it will go out, and by the time it reaches infinity, it has slowed down to V equal to zero. So that velocity is the escape velocity. So E equal to zero gives escape velocity.And that, of course, is equal to 2 M 2 G M M. Yeah. In this case, M, that is the mass of Earth. Yeah, but the number of kilometers per second for Earth.And this number, if you estimate, is about a hundred times the speed of a car, of an ordinary car. But of course, if you send a rocket from the Earth, you must first have enough thrust to make it escape from the atmosphere. And then you have to have this speed before it can go out of the Earth's attraction.There's an R here, sorry. One of the most important events in the history of mankind is the understanding of planetary orbits by Newton. In China, the ancient philosophers did not have, from today's viewpoint, the correct view about the structure of the universe.The Greeks also had an incorrect view, but their way of thinking about it eventually led to Newton's discovery. First, in the Greek times, the most important person was Ptolemy. He lived in Greece from 90 to 168 AD.The way that he was thinking, and in fact the way all the Greeks were thinking, was that the Earth is at the center of the universe. And furthermore, they had the following feeling. They wanted to construct a universe which is most beautiful.Because they believed God must create a most perfect, most beautiful structure. And what is most beautiful? The circle is most beautiful. So they called it the harmony of circles.They thought that the Earth is at the center of the universe, and the stars, the planets, would all go around in circles. But that's not correct. By observation, they knew that, for example, the motion of Mars is very complicated.So they thought it's not a circle. The next complicated but beautiful thing is a circle on a circle. What is a circle on a circle? If you have a ball here, and a circle, while the center is moving in a big circle, there's a particle which goes around this, so you would get something like this.That's called circle on circle. And they tried to adjust the sizes of these two circles to make it match the motion of the planets. It didn't work.So they make it a circle on a circle on a circle. And since there are many planets, so there are many circles, and at one point, somebody had the complete structure of the planets' motion. There were 80 some circles.And that was the general way of thinking about planetary motion. Now why are planetary motions so very important? Because there's agriculture. When you develop agriculture, you know that agriculture depends on the understanding of the seasons.And understanding of the seasons depends on understanding of the motion of the stars around the Earth as you see them. So that astronomy is an important subject in every civilization. It's an obvious thing.Because if you develop agriculture, then astronomy becomes important. But there are regularities of the motion of the stars, of the planets. But there are also strange motions.So people began to try to puzzle out these strange motions. And therefore, this circle on circle on circle kind of idea. That held back Western astronomy for more than 2,000 years, until Copernicus.He advocated heliocenter theory. You all know that Galileo subscribed to this theory. Galileo believed in this theory and was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Nevertheless, many astronomers began to think about the heliocenter theory. The next important development was Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe was an observer.He made accurate measurements of the position of various planets year after year. And after he died, his data was analyzed by Kepler. So Brahe was an experimental astronomer.Kepler was a theoretical astronomer. It was very interesting how Kepler made his great discoveries. He concentrated on the motion of Mars.And the motion of Mars, according to Copernicus' idea, was mostly a circle. In fact, the orbit of Mars as we know it today is almost a circle. But because Brahe's data was very accurate, so Kepler was able to accurately map the position of Mars and found that it's not a circle.It doesn't fit a circle. It almost fits a circle, but not quite. And then one day he suddenly realized it's not a circle at all.It's an ellipse. This is one of the most important events in the history of mankind. The reason that he could land on the idea of an ellipse is also because the Greeks had studied ellipses in detail.We all know, and I'm sure you have learned, plane geometry, Euclid's geometry in high schools. But the Greeks developed geometry much more than Euclid. After Euclid, they studied what is called a conic section.A conic section is you take a cone, take a circular cone, and you can cut it. If you cut it this way, obviously it's a circle. If you cut it this way, it's an ellipse.So this way you get a circle. This way you get an ellipse. If you cut it this way, then it has two branches.One cut in the top, one cut in the bottom. You get a hyperbola. Circle is a circle.

Ellipse is a cone. Hyperbola is called a conic section. All of these curves, their relationship to each other, and their relationship to the cone, were studied in great detail.Beautiful work in Greek times after Euclid. And Kepler, being a theorist, knew these conic section results very well. That is perhaps the reason why it dawned on him one day that the reason that one cannot fit a circular orbit to the trajectory of Mars was because it's not a circle, it is an ellipse.And once that's done, he formulated the three laws. These laws, in today's language, are called empirical laws. Empirical means experimental.The first law is that planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. An ellipse always has two focuses. An ellipse has something called ellipticity.I think ellipticity is called ellipticity, right? Ellipticity. When this ellipticity is zero, it is a circle. When it is one, it is a parabola.When it is greater than one, it is a hyperbola. We'll come to this later. So the first law says that all planetary orbits are ellipses.And that was very accurately correct for a long time. Then, of course, when people had more accurate measurements, they found slight corrections to this. And that correction needed additional considerations.And that's outside of our discussion this semester. The second law says that a planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. This is what it means.When a planet is moving, for example, in one unit time, it has a small triangle. In another unit time, these triangles are in the same area. As it goes around.A planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. The way that he formulated this law shows that he was a very geometrical person. He evidently plotted the curves and observed that when the planet moves slower, that when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower.But this distance is longer, and this area becomes the same. So, when it comes to here, it moves very fast. But in the unit time, it still sweeps the same area.The third law says the period, cube, divided by... T is the period around the sun. A is the semi-major axis. From this point to this point, that distance is called 2A.Different satellites all around the same sun share the same value of T cubed divided by... T squared divided by A cubed. Sorry, T squared. Kepler died in the year 1630.A few years later, Newton was born. Newton explained. Newton was both an experimentalist and a theorist.He was a great experimentalist as well as a theorist. But perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind was his discovery of calculus, of the origin of the planetary motion,

The most important contribution of Newton was he explained the three laws, Kepler's three laws, through the theory of gravitation. These three laws are explained in the book, but it was too simple because it did not succeed in proving the three laws. We are now going to go through the proofs of all three laws.（牛顿最重要的贡献在于，他通过万有引力理论解释了开普勒三大定律。虽然书中对这些定律有所阐述，但过于简略，未能成功证明其正确性。现在我们将逐一推导这三条定律的证明过程。）

So first, proof of second law. The second law is the easiest to prove. We had the following theorem. Several weeks ago we had proven this theorem by straightforward differentiation. If this is the sun, and this is the earth, and this angle is theta, this distance is r. That's called polar coordinates. Using polar coordinates, we found that acceleration has two components.（首先，证明第二定律。第二定律是最容易证明的。我们有以下定理。几周前，我们通过直接微分证明了这个定理。如果这是太阳，这是地球，这个角度是θ，这个距离是r。这被称为极坐标。使用极坐标，我们发现加速度有两个分量。）

One is along the direction of r, the other is along the direction of theta. This is the direction of r, and the direction of theta is perpendicular to it. So let us apply Newton's law. Newton's law says that the force is equal to m a. You multiply this by m, should be equal to force. But the force is only in the r direction, so therefore the theta direction has to be equal to zero. In other words, Newton's law says two r dot theta dot plus r theta double dot is equal to zero.（一个是沿着r的方向，另一个是沿着θ的方向。这是r的方向，而θ的方向与之垂直。让我们应用牛顿定律。牛顿定律说力等于m乘以a。你把这个乘以m，应该等于力。但力只在r方向上，因此θ方向必须等于零。换句话说，牛顿定律说两个r点θ点加上rθ双点等于零。）

There's another. We also know that this acceleration, m times that, m times r double dot minus r theta dot squared, has to be equal to minus g m m over r squared. That's the meaning of f equal to m a. Okay, let's take out the first one.

That one means d dt of r squared theta dot. That's equal to two r r dot theta dot plus r squared theta double dot. Just by straight computation.

And that has to be equal to zero, because let's call this one, this two. Therefore, r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. r squared theta dot is equal to r times r theta dot is equal to a constant.

Now, this is r. This angle is r theta dot. r theta dot dt is this angle. Therefore, one half, but one half of r times r theta dot dt is equal to area swept.

Area swept in dt. This is equal to one half of r squared theta dot dt is equal to one half c dt. In other words, area swept in dt is a constant in dt, and that's second law, i.e. this area swept is proportional to dt.

It's a constant in dt. But r times r theta dot is also the angular momentum explanation. r times r theta dot is a constant.

It's equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. In other words, the second law of Kepler is nothing but the conservation of angular momentum. As long as the force is always along the direction of r, there is conservation of angular momentum, and then there is Kepler's second law.In other words, suppose the force is not one over r squared, it's one over r cubed, or anything, which depends only on r, but with no theta component, then second law always is correct, i.e. second law follows from angular momentum conservation plus central force. Central force means that the force is always directed to the center. In other words, no theta component.Next, we are going to prove the first law, but before we do that, let me box this equation. r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. Now we go to equation 2. Equation 2 becomes r double dot minus r theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.In fact, let's put m back in. I multiply both sides by r and integrate. I get m over r squared plus r squared theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.If I differentiate this, this becomes this, multiplied by r dot, and this becomes this. Let's forget about this. It's simpler that we directly use the energy law.

We know the energy. We have proven 20 minutes ago that the total energy is a kinetic energy, one half mv squared plus u, which is mmg over r. That is equal to a constant. This actually follows from this.

Only you integrate this, you multiply this by r dot and integrate, you get this expression. But since we have already the general statement, so we might as well start from here. This is the kinetic energy.

This is the potential energy. And that results equal to constant. We call it E. And again, we divide the case into E equal to zero, E greater than zero, or E less than zero.For a particle which can go to infinity, which can barely go to infinity, E is equal to zero. If E is greater than zero, that means that when r is infinity, this part is positive. So it can go to infinity with a finite velocity.If it is negative, this part cannot become zero, because if this part is zero, this is positive. If E is negative, that never happens. In other words, case one, E less than zero cannot escape.This is the case that we'll deal with first. Later on, we'll deal with E equal to zero and E greater than zero. So let us write E is equal to one-half of m. V squared is r dot squared plus r squared theta dot squared minus mg over r. r dot is equal to dr, dc, the dc, the dt.So I can write it this way. And therefore, this is equal to one-half of m dr d theta squared plus r squared times theta dot squared. But to see the dots, woman, but we have r squared theta dot equal to a constant.We have that formula before, according to the second law. So I can use that to eliminate theta dot. So this becomes c squared over r fourth.Let us now multiply this whole by r fourth. So we get E r fourth is equal to m over two. E is negative.So you will write minus a squared to be equal to 2E over mc squared. Note that E is negative, so I write minus a squared. B is equal to 2mg over c squared.I saw this equation many years ago, of course. So yesterday, I tried to solve this equation. The more I solved it, the more complicated it became.Later, after thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a trick. This trick is like this. You have to change a variable.If you want to use this r, you can take this r to the other side. Then open a square. Then you get dr d theta.And then you divide after you get theta. It's an integral over dr of a complicated expression. You can do it that way, too, but that's not an easy way.Then I remembered there was a trick. I don't know who first found the trick. Newton must have found the equivalent trick, but he did not write it in his book.The trick is to invert r. Put r equal to 1 over rho. Then dr d rho, dr d theta, becomes dr d rho, d rho d theta. But dr d rho is equal to 1 over rho squared.So we put that in there. You get 1 over rho fourth, d rho d theta squared, plus 1 over rho squared, is equal to minus a squared over rho fourth, plus b over rho cubed. You multiply by rho fourth.You get d rho d theta squared is equal to minus a squared, plus b rho, minus rho squared. The advantage of this compared with this, it's very similar. But here dr d theta has r squared term, r cubed term, r fourth term.In rho, it has become constant rho and rho squared. So this is simpler than this. And that's the trick.When you have something like this, the natural thing is to perfect the square. So this is a minus rho, minus b over 2 squared, plus b squared over 4. That takes care of these two terms, minus a squared. So let's call this sigma squared.So we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2, r by 1 over rho. Then this becomes b sigma d theta squared, is equal to minus sigma squared, plus k squared. Where we define k squared to be b squared over four minus a squared.How do I know it's a positive number and not a negative number? It can't be negative because the left side is positive. So unless this is positive, the equation doesn't make sense. When you have an equation like this, by inspection you know what to do.You should write sigma as k sine theta, sine phi. When you do that, d sigma d theta becomes k cosine phi d phi d theta squared. Is equal to k square minus k square sine square theta.A sine square phi, which is equal to k squared cosine square phi. The reason that we do this is because the k square cosine square phi cancels. So we get d phi d theta equal to 1. So d phi d theta is equal to plus minus 1. We need only a constant of d phi d theta equal to 1. So therefore, we can write phi is equal to theta plus a constant.So we put that back in. We get rho is equal to 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine of phi theta plus constant. The constant doesn't matter.All it means is you change the origin of theta. So I can make that constant equal to 0. So I would get 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine theta. I can write this as b over 2 times 1 plus e, where e is equal to k, 2k over b. It's 2 over b times k. k is square root of b squared over 4 minus a squared.So therefore, it's equal to square root of 1 minus 4a squared over b squared. And that is equal to square root of 1 minus 2c squared over m squared g squared times minus e over m. This is a very important quantity. It's called the eccentricity.It tells you how ellipse, how much it deviates from a circle. Let's look at the expression. It's the square root of 1 minus c. c is related to the angular momentum, how much it sweeps per unit time.m squared g squared are related to the mass of the sun and the gravitational constant. Minus e over m. e is the energy of the planet. That e is clearly proportional to m. In other words, if the Earth were twice as massive, you can think of it as two Earths stuck together.And each of them would still follow the same orbit. So therefore, e is always proportional to m. So e over m is the per unit mass energy for the planet. And we get this.And this is... We shall now show that it is an ellipse. It is an ellipse because this is another trick. When you have an equation which has r in it, you always follow what we are going to demonstrate as a trick.I take this formula and multiply both by r. So I get 1 is equal to b over 2 times r plus e times r sine theta. r sine theta is y. You have an equation which both has x, y, z in it and has r in it. The way to do it is to move everything to one side which does not contain r.

And then square it. In other words, you get 1 over B over 2EY is equal to B over 2R. Now I square both sides.

So I get 1 minus BEY plus B squared E squared Y squared over 4 is equal to B squared 4R squared, which is X squared Y squared. This way we get rid of the R. R has a square root and is not convenient. Now if you look at this, it is an ellipse.This E is less than 1. How do I know it's an ellipse? Because you know when you have a quadratic equation in X and Y, we'll show that this is an ellipse in a minute. Let us multiply this by 4 over B squared. Multiply it by 4 over B squared.I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B plus E squared Y squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared Y squared. I shall define this.Oh, sorry. I get 4B squared is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared times Y squared plus 4E divided by 1 minus E squared. 2E.

1 minus E squared Y squared plus. This is 2. 2EY. This is 2E.

2EY over B minus minus 4E squared over B squared or minus E squared. What I am doing here is to divide this into squares. I move this over here and divide it into squares.I shall now define an alpha. Let me see if I am doing this right or wrong. I shall now define an alpha.Square is equal to 4 over B squared. I shall now define an alpha. I shall now define an alpha.1 minus E squared. This is equal to alpha squared over 1 minus E squared. Where Y prime is equal to Y plus 2E.So you can see that this function is an X squared. 1 minus E squared is positive. So this is a typical ellipse.If you want to write it as a standard ellipse, you have to write it like this. You have to divide this whole thing by 2. This has now become a standard ellipse. I think you all recognize it.This number is bigger than this number. Because this is divided by 1 minus E squared. So its major axis is called A. Semi-major axis.So this ellipse is like this. Let me see if I am doing this right. Yes.Its semi-major axis is this A. It is equal to the square root of this thing. It is equal to alpha over 1 minus E squared. This is called A. Minor axis is called B. It is this distance.What is this equal to? It is equal to the square root of this. It is equal to alpha. It is QED.We have now proven that the orbit is an ellipse. Before the ellipse shifted, Y' then Y. Before the ellipse shifted, this is a center. This is a focus.We are not going to prove this. You can try it. It has a standard formula.You know the major axis and the minor axis. You know where the focus is. You will find that the focus is the shift from Y to Y' just now.Okay. Now we have the third law. Proof of the third law.The third law tells you that its period has something to do with its semi-major axis. We use its area. Area of ellipse.You know that the area of a circle is πr². If an ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis, a and b, its area is πab. If a is equal to b, it becomes πa².So we know that just now we have a major axis and a minor axis. So it is definitely α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Now, one half of r²θ' is equal to ddt of area swept.We have this formula before. Because this is r, this is rθ'dt. So one half of that is equal to area swept.One half of that is area swept per unit time. So if r²θ' is equal to 2c, then it is c over 2. Because r²θ' is equal to c. Therefore, the total area of the ellipse divided by the period is equal to this. Since this is per unit area, the total area divided by t is this.So we know that the total area is equal to tc over 2. But this is equal to α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. So we have this formula. We have calculated the period.The period is equal to 2 over c. The total area is equal to this π. πα² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Then we know that a is equal to α over 1 minus e². This is the formula we just had.So we can calculate t² over a³. After calculating this algebra for a long time, we can prove that this is equal to 4π² over mg. This is in the book.But the book doesn't prove this. Because the book doesn't talk about ellipse. It only talks about the circle case.Now we are proving that this is general. And this is of course the Kepler's third law. So t² over a³ is a constant which depends on the sun's mass.Different planets have the same constant. So we have proven all three all three Kepler's laws. Next time, we are going to discuss the other two cases.Namely, e is equal to 0 and e is greater than 0. I'll be in my class in my office this afternoon between 4 and 5. Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this. So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun...

Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1. The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery. Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established. 所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things? The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho. So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine. It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one.

And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week.

I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared.

So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared. And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious. 


Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. （好的，现在我们进入下一章。我们都知道有固体、液体和气体。这本书将后两者称为流体。流体的特性是没有剪切力。我们之前已经讨论过这一点。液体没有剪切力，也没有阻力。顺便说一下，我想介绍一下强度量和广延量的概念。我不知道“intensive”和“extensive”在中文里怎么说。）

Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive.

Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure. Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject. The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute. The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years.

began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity.

Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity. And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity.

He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy.

So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed.

That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found.

So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004.

There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery.

I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property.

And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery.

Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia.

We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid.

The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order.（固体可以有不同的相，因为它可以有不同的晶体结构。现在我们知道液体也可以有超相和非超相。而现在我们也知道固体可以有超相和非超相。所有这些都基于长程有序的概念。什么是长程有序？晶体具有长程有序。液体和气体则没有长程有序。）

Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order.

So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term.

It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order.

But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things.

I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order.

All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class.

I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here.

There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom.

The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface.

The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation.

So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top.

Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere.

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance.

You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil.

So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1.

But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2.

Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever. A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath.

If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area.（如果这两者的高度相同，那么压力也是相同的。所以如果我在这里施加一个压力P，那么这里的压力也是相同的。但如果这里的面积是A，这里的面积是A'，那么这里的总重量，这个重量，或者说这个重量就是PA'G。如果A'非常大，这里的总压力就是PAG，这个比例等于A'除以A。抱歉，没有G。因为两个压力相同，所以力与面积成正比。）

And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight.

But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance.

So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy.

But what you can magnify is the force. Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this.

I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng.

So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent.

So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this.

If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow.（如果他们施加的压力过大，水流就会变得湍急。你知道湍流是什么样子的。实际上，当水从水龙头流出时，如果流速过快，就会形成湍流。它会变得混乱。这种中国都流传。一个著名的问题是：在多大的压差或中心流速下，流动会从层流转变为湍流。）

This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem.（这是其中一个著名的问题，而这个问题至今仍在研究中。但中心的林教授（C.C. Lin）是该领域的早期重要贡献者之一。事情是这样的，在20世纪20年代，著名的海森堡——那个开创了量子力学的海森堡——在撰写他的博士论文时，就探讨了这个问题。）

He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work.（他是德国索末菲的学生。他们都是德国人，海森堡并没有写关于量子力学的论文。他写了一篇关于湍流的论文，并获得了博士学位，后来他成为了量子力学的伟大奠基者之一。但他的博士论文中关于层流转变为湍流的理论是否正确曾引发争议。大约20年后，当时的研究生林家翘撰写了论文，澄清了这一争议，在某种程度上很大程度上支持了海森堡的工作。）

Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube. So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow,
