OK, let us start from what we left off last time. This exercise, it's a string which consists of two different material. So the equation is still this.But V squared is equal to V one squared for X less than L one is V squared is equal to V two squared for X greater than L one. So we similarly take a Y is equal to A of X times B of D. Then we get A double X divided by A of X times V squared of X is equal to B. The left both sides are functions of X and T, but the left side is independent of T. The right side is independent of X. So therefore, the whole thing is independent of either T or X. So it's equal to a numerical constant and we write it as minus omega squared. How about if it's a plus omega squared? You can study that.If you study that, you will see that this part, the T equation, would give you an exponentially increasing or decreasing solution, and that's not interesting. （好的，让我们从上次停下的地方开始。这个练习，是一根由两种不同材料组成的弦。所以方程仍然是这个。但当X小于L1时，V的平方等于V1的平方；当X大于L1时，V的平方等于V2的平方。同样地，我们设Y等于A(X)乘以B(T)。于是我们得到A的二阶导数除以A(X)乘以V(X)的平方等于B。等式两边都是关于X和T的函数，但左边与T无关，右边与X无关。因此，整个表达式既不依赖于T也不依赖于X，它等于一个数值常数，我们将其记为负的欧米茄平方。如果是正的欧米茄平方会怎样呢？你可以研究一下。如果你研究的话，会发现这部分，即关于T的方程，会给出一个指数增长或衰减的解，这并不有趣。）


So we only study the case where it's negative. And therefore, B becomes harmonic.That's exactly the same as the usual case. What is interesting is the A part. So the A part gives us this equation.For the two regions, we have two different equations. And we also have the boundary condition that A of X is equal to zero for X equal to zero. And A at L1 plus L2 is equal to zero for X equal to L1 plus L2.Because the string is fixed at these two points. So if we use that to solve this equation, we get A of X is equal to A zero sine. You can have a cosine also, but the cosine part must be zero in order to satisfy the first boundary condition.Similarly, we can write on the next one.（所以我们只研究负值的情况。因此，B变为谐波，这与通常情况完全相同。有趣的是A部分。A部分给出了这个方程。对于两个区域，我们有两个不同的方程。我们还有一个边界条件：当X等于零时，A(X)等于零；当X等于L1加L2时，A在L1加L2处等于零，因为弦在这两点是固定的。如果我们用这个条件来解这个方程，可以得到A(X)等于A0乘以正弦函数。你也可以使用余弦函数，但为了满足第一个边界条件，余弦部分必须为零。类似地，我们可以在下一个方程中这样写。）

This is for X less than L1. For the right end, for the large X, we get omega over V2 times X. But we want to put the boundary condition in.And when X is equal to L1 plus L2, it has to be equal to zero. So it's obviously it's this. Because if we write it this way, when X is equal to L1 plus L2, automatically it's a zero.In other words, the way we write it already has the boundary condition built in. Now we do matching. Matching is to match.No, matching is to match. It's where L1 is. A of L1 is equal to continuous.A prime of L1 is equal to continuous. us. For x less than L1 and x greater than L1, we should make this equal to.So we get A0 sine omega over V1 of L1 is equal to A1 sine omega over V2 of minus L2. （当X小于L1时，适用此表达式。对于右端大X值的情况，我们得到ω除以V2乘以X。但需要代入边界条件——当X等于L1加L2时，其值必须为零。显然就是这个表达式，因为这样书写时，当X等于L1加L2时会自动归零。换句话说，我们当前的写法已经内置了边界条件。现在进行匹配。匹配就是要对应...不，匹配就是要对应。关键点在L1处：A(L1)必须连续，A'(L1)也必须连续。对于X小于L1和X大于L1的情况，我们需要使两者相等。因此得到：A0乘以sin(ω/V1·L1)等于A1乘以sin[ω/V2·(-L2)]。）


And if we take the derivative, we get A0 omega over V1 cosine of omega over V1 L1 is equal to A1 times omega over V2 times cosine of minus L2. The first equation is the matching of A. The second is the matching of A prime. Now let us divide these two equations so as to eliminate the A0 and A1. So I get, and we can eliminate the omega because we have omega on both sides. So we get V1 cotangent of omega over V1 L1 is equal to 1 over V2 of cotangent of L2 with a minus sign. This equation determines omega. I had not known this before, that if you have a string with two different kinds of material so that the velocity is different, you would get a very complicated equation like this. （如果我们对两边求导，得到 A0 ω/V1 · cos(ω/V1 L1) = A1 · ω/V2 · cos(-L2)。第一个方程是振幅A的匹配条件，第二个方程是A的导数匹配条件。现在我们将这两个方程相除，以消去A0和A1。由于方程两边都有ω，我们可以约去ω。于是得到 V1 · cot(ω/V1 L1) = -1/V2 · cot(L2)。这个方程决定了ω的取值。我之前并不知道，当一根弦由两种不同材料组成（导致波速不同时），会推导出如此复杂的方程。）


Let us take the case of L1 over V1 is equal to L2 over V2. V1 and V2 depend on the material. The book uses iron and aluminum. So once you have V1 and V2, you can choose L1 and L2 to be equal such that this is true. In that case, you get 1 over V1 plus 1 over V2 times cotangent of omega V1 L1 is equal to 0. So this is equal to 0. That is very interesting. You would get omega equal to a series of possibilities and you have the integer n in it. But in general, so that is this case. In general, let us call this equation alpha. In general, alpha gives and you get the lowest solution for omega and the next lowest solution of omega may not have an integral ratio of each other. So I did not know this before.（让我们以L1/V1等于L2/V2的情况为例。V1和V2取决于材料。书中使用的是铁和铝。因此，一旦你有了V1和V2，你可以选择L1和L2相等，使得这个等式成立。在这种情况下，你会得到1/V1加上1/V2乘以ωV1L1的余切等于0。所以这等于0。这非常有趣。你会得到ω等于一系列可能性，并且其中包含整数n。但一般来说，这就是这种情况。通常，我们称这个方程为α。通常，α给出了ω的最低解，而下一个最低解的ω可能彼此之间没有整数比例关系。所以，我之前并不知道这一点。）

I did not know that if you have a string which consists of two different material, if you plug it in general, it may create sounds which are very peculiar and may not be harmonious. Any questions about this particular problem? One lesson that you can learn from this is that when you have complicated equations, if you choose your steps carefully, the equations may become very simple. For example, here the reason that we got to this simple result, relatively simple result, is because we chose these two very cleverly. If you did not do it, if you put a face in it, you get more complicated looking equations and then things would not be so simple. （我不知道如果一根弦由两种不同材料组成，当你一般性地拨动它时，可能会产生非常奇特且可能不和谐的声音。关于这个特定问题有什么疑问吗？你可以从中吸取的一个教训是，当你面对复杂的方程时，如果仔细选择步骤，方程可能会变得非常简单。例如，我们之所以能得到这个相对简单的结果，是因为我们非常巧妙地选择了这两个因素。如果你没有这样做，而是随意处理，就会得到看起来更复杂的方程，事情就不会这么简单了。）

So one thing that you should remember when you do an exercise or when you take an exam is to choose your notations and your strategy carefully. If you do that well, things simplify. If you do that not so well, you get more complicated. Things become more and more complicated. Okay, now we go to the next chapter. The waves that we have been talking about are called transverse waves.Because the direction of the motion is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the waves. But there are also longitudinal waves. And sound waves is one example.If I draw a wave front, these are called wave fronts. When sound waves travel, the air molecules vibrate at every point.（因此，在做练习或考试时，有一点你必须牢记：要谨慎选择符号和解题策略。如果处理得当，问题就会简化；反之，情况会变得越来越复杂。好了，现在我们进入下一章。我们之前讨论的波被称为横波，因为振动方向与波的传播方向垂直。但也存在纵波，声波就是一个例子。如果我画一个波前（这些被称为波前），当声波传播时，空气分子在每个点都会振动。）


But they do not all vibrate at the same time in one direction.So this is where the density of waves is high. And these are called wave fronts. These are the crests, crests being maximum density.So this is maximum density, this is maximum density. And at the next moment, the maximum density will propagate. So it moves this way.Water waves is a transverse wave, not a longitudinal wave. But it has crests which move along. So these sound waves are longitudinal waves, for example.In the next 20 minutes, I'm going to derive the equation of motion for the sound waves. The book has a derivation. It's difficult to understand.What we are going to go through is much simpler once you have understood it. （但它们并非同时朝同一方向振动。因此，这里就是波密度高的区域。这些被称为波前，也就是波峰所在——波峰代表着密度最大值。此处是密度最大值，这里也是密度最大值。而下一刻，这个密度最大值就会传播出去，于是波就这样向前推进。水波属于横波，而非纵波。但它也有向前移动的波峰。而声波则属于纵波，例如接下来要讨论的这种。在接下来的20分钟里，我将推导声波的运动方程。教科书上虽有推导过程，但晦涩难懂。只要理解了我们即将讲解的方法，你会发现它要简单得多。）



And it's more general. What we are going to go through, in contrast to what the book tells you, is a bit like deriving Newtonian planetary motion by calculus compared with deriving Newtonian planetary motion by geometry.The derivation by geometry are always tricky and complicated, and in some sense useless, because you cannot use it in the future. While the derivation by calculus, once you have understood it, is much simpler. And furthermore, it allows you to make further progress.So it may look difficult, but actually it's simpler. So we are going to go through a derivation of a wave equation for sound. I think in high school you have all learned that the reason that there is sound is because there's longitudinal vibration of the air molecules.（而且它更为通用。与书中所讲的不同，我们将要经历的过程，有点像是用微积分推导牛顿行星运动，与用几何方法推导牛顿行星运动相比。几何推导总是复杂且繁琐，在某种意义上甚至无用，因为你无法在未来应用它。而一旦你理解了微积分推导，它就简单得多。更重要的是，它还能让你取得进一步的进展。所以它看起来可能很难，但实际上更简单。接下来，我们将推导声波的波动方程。我想在高中时你们都学过，声音存在的原因是空气分子的纵向振动。）


So we try to write down the equations. First, the lowest density of air molecules. u is horizontal velocity.u is a function of x and t. Rho is also a function of x and t. The sound wave moves along the x direction. First, we are going to write down the equation of continuity. Rho times u with respect to x derivative plus rho with respect to time derivative is equal to zero.This equation is very important. In fact, the way Maxwell developed Maxwell's equations, in 1865, Maxwell derived Maxwell's equations. He had been working on that for several years.But it was in 1865 that he wrote down the right equation. The way that he wrote down the right equation is deeply related to this equation.（所以我们尝试写下这些方程。首先是最低空气分子密度。u代表水平速度，u是x和t的函数。Rho也是x和t的函数。声波沿x方向传播。首先，我们要写下连续性方程。Rho乘以u对x的导数加上Rho对时间的导数等于零。这个方程非常重要。事实上，麦克斯韦在1865年推导出麦克斯韦方程组的方式与此方程密切相关。他为此工作了数年，但直到1865年才写下正确的方程。他得出正确方程的方法与这个方程有着深刻联系。）

Only he was not talking about sound waves.He was talking about the conservation of charge. This is the equation of continuity. Or it is the conservation of mass.It's the equation of the conservation of mass. When Maxwell wrote down the equation for the conservation of charge, and because of that, he introduced what is called a displacement current. And because of that introduction, he was able to derive what I told you once before already, that there's electromagnetic waves out of his equations.And he can calculate the velocity of electromagnetic waves from his equations. And that velocity turns out to be almost the velocity of the known light velocity.（但他讨论的不是声波，而是电荷守恒。这就是连续性方程，或者说质量守恒定律——质量守恒方程。当麦克斯韦写下电荷守恒方程时，他因此引入了所谓的位移电流。正是由于这一概念的引入，他才能够从我之前告诉过你们的方程中推导出电磁波的存在。并且他还能通过这些方程计算出电磁波的速度，而这个速度结果几乎与已知的光速一致。）


At that time, there was no accurate measure of the velocity of light.And he noticed that the velocity of light is the same as the wave velocity out of his equations. So he said that light is, in fact, the electromagnetic waves. That's a historical event in the history of mankind.So this equation is extremely important, and it's extremely easy to derive. Because if I think of this motion, if I think of a column of air, and I ask, air is moving. So air mass is moving in, and air mass is moving out.The question that I want to ask is, the number, the mass that moves out, the mass that moves out at B is equal to what? In time, delta t is equal to rho U A delta t at x plus delta x. U delta t, in time interval delta t, this sheet moves to here.（当时，还没有准确测量光速的方法。他注意到光速与他方程中的波速相同，因此他说光实际上就是电磁波。这是人类历史上的一个重大事件。所以这个方程极其重要，而且推导起来也非常简单。因为如果考虑这种运动，想象一列空气柱，空气在流动。空气质量流入，空气质量流出。我想问的是，流出的质量，在B点流出的质量等于什么？在时间Δt内，等于ρUAΔt在x+Δx处。UΔt，在时间间隔Δt内，这层空气移动到这里。）


So this mass moves out. A U delta t is the volume.The volume times rho is the mass that moves out at x plus delta x. The mass that moves in at A in delta t is rho U A delta t at x. So the net, of course, is rho U A delta t, the derivative with respect to x, times delta x. So per unit time, per unit time, net increase of mass is equal to d rho U A d x times delta x. Oh, no, this is negative. Because this is going out. Because this is going out, and this is coming in.So it's a net decrease. This net increase is negative. So this is equal to, it's a net increase.So this is equal to d rho d t. The mass inside is A rho delta x d d t. So when you cancel out A and delta x, it becomes an equation. So it's a U x.（这部分质量向外移动。UΔt表示体积。体积乘以ρ就是在x+Δx处移出的质量。在Δt时间内从A处流入的质量在x处为ρUAΔt。因此，净质量自然是ρUAΔt对x的导数乘以Δx。所以单位时间内，质量的净增加等于d(ρUA)/dx乘以Δx。哦，不对，这是负的。因为这是流出的。因为这部分流出，而另一部分流入，所以实际上是净减少。这个净增加是负的。因此，这等于dρ/dt。内部质量是AρΔx d/dt。当你约去A和Δx后，就得到了一个方程。即Ux。）


This equation is one of the simplest and the fundamental equation of fluid motion. It says there's a conservation of mass.The air mass can be moving in all directions. This is one dimension. One dimension of space, one dimension of time.There are three dimensions of space, three dimensions of time. It becomes a divergence of rho U. The other equation we are going to write down is the force equation. The one I just talked about is kinematics.It's only a matter of balancing the mass. We are talking about the mass moving out, mass moving in. The difference relates to how much mass is increasing inside.So that's what we did. Now we want to look at the pressure.（这个方程是最简单且基础的流体运动方程之一。它阐述了质量守恒定律。空气团可以向各个方向运动。这是一个维度——一个空间维度，一个时间维度。实际上存在三个空间维度和三个时间维度。这就形成了ρU的散度。我们将要写下的另一个方程是力方程。我刚才讨论的是运动学问题，仅涉及质量平衡。我们讨论的是流出质量和流入质量，其差异与内部质量增加量相关。这就是我们所做的。现在我们要研究压力问题。）

We again go back to the one dimension.We want to derive Px is equal to minus rho U t. There is a pressure at this point. If the whole thing is moving uniformly, then these two pressures are the same. So they balance each other.So therefore what's inside suffers no force. And therefore its momentum does not change. But if the pressures are not the same, then you have dP dx.So the left side is the pressure difference, which is the net force on the inside. The right side is the momentum, is the increase of momentum. So this equation merely says the net force on this sheet is equal to minus P is the net force.Because if the pressure on this side is big and the pressure on this side is small, then of course the net force is negative.（我们再次回到一维情况。我们需要推导出Px等于负的ρUt。这一点存在压力。如果整个系统匀速运动，那么这两个压力相等，因此相互抵消。所以内部不受力，动量也不会改变。但如果压力不相等，就会出现dP/dx。左边是压力差，即内部受到的净力。右边是动量，即动量的增量。这个方程仅仅表示：作用在这个薄层上的净力等于负P（因为如果这一侧压力大而另一侧压力小，净力显然为负值）。）

So this is the net force on that sheet. And the right side is the time change of momentum.So that's Newton's equation. Is everybody happy? Okay. What we have done is we have written down in one dimension, one space dimension, one time dimension, the two fundamental equations of hydrodynamics.We are going to talk about small vibrations. Small vibration means that the rho and u are small. The u and the derivative of u are small.Rho is not small. But the rho of the change is small. Rho is not small.But the rho of the derivative, rho u, rho x, and rho t are small. When there is a sound, the velocity, the density of air, it remains the usual density. But there is a small vibration, so there is smaller changes.（所以这就是作用在该薄片上的净力。而右侧则是动量的时间变化。这就是牛顿方程。大家都明白了吗？好的。我们所做的就是在单一空间维度、单一时间维度下，写下了流体动力学的两个基本方程。接下来我们将讨论微小振动。微小振动意味着ρ和u都很小。u及其导数都很小。ρ本身并不小，但ρ的变化量很小。ρ并不小，但其导数ρu、ρx和ρt都很小。当存在声音时，空气的速度和密度仍保持常规密度。但由于存在微小振动，所以会产生更小的变化。）

So these are small. Then let the rho of the density, which is general rho zero, is not small. The pressure, the value of pressure, P zero is not small.Because Px, Px, Pt are small. Does everybody understand what I'm saying? It's actually very obvious. So we are now going to process these equations, but neglect higher orders.We shall examine the two equations, neglecting all second order terms. The two small quantities, we shall neglect them. Of course, we shall neglect zero order, first order, and higher order.Let's see what this becomes. First, let's look at this equation. The ux is small.Rho x, rho t is small. This rho is equal to rho zero plus rho change. But that change, the u on top, becomes second order.（这些都很小。那么设密度ρ，一般ρ₀，并不小。压强，压强的值P₀也不小。因为Pₓ、Pₜ都很小。大家都明白我在说什么吗？这其实非常明显。所以我们现在要处理这些方程，但忽略高阶项。我们将检查这两个方程，忽略所有二阶项。这两个小量，我们将忽略它们。当然，我们会忽略零阶、一阶和高阶项。让我们看看这变成什么。首先，看看这个方程。uₓ很小。ρₓ、ρₜ都很小。这个ρ等于ρ₀加上ρ的变化。但那个变化，上面的u，变成了二阶项。）

So we forget about that change. So I write it like this. Is everybody happy? Then let's look at the equation below.The equation below is Px plus rho u t plus rho t u. This is small, this is small, this is small. The change is small. We can ignore this, because it's automatically second order.This is the same as before. We can write it as rho zero. What we are doing is called perturbation theory.Perturbation is the spirit that you divide all the quantities into different orders. Then you study each order. That was developed in the 18th century by many people, but especially Laplace and Lagrange, because it's very rare that you can solve an exact problem.Newton solved the motion of planetary orbits.（所以我们忘记那个变化。我就这样写。大家都满意吗？那我们来看看下面的方程。下面的方程是Px加上ρut加上ρtu。这个很小，这个很小，这个也很小。变化很小。我们可以忽略这个，因为它自动就是二阶的。这和之前一样。我们可以写成ρ零。我们正在做的是所谓的微扰理论。微扰的精髓在于你把所有量分成不同的阶数。然后你研究每一阶。这是在18世纪由许多人发展起来的，尤其是拉普拉斯和拉格朗日，因为能解决精确问题的情况非常罕见。牛顿解决了行星轨道的运动问题。）


That was very lucky. But if you talk about a three-body problem, you cannot solve it.There's no general solution. And yet people had to study the motion of the planets or of the moon. So how do you do it? You develop the perturbation idea.So perturbation theory was developed greatly in the 18th century, and that still has been developed today. Hydrodynamics is a very complicated subject, and people use different ideas about perturbation. So the spirit of perturbation is one of the pervading spirits in applied mathematics.In this particular case, the perturbation theory is very simple. So now what do we do about P? So we write P as P0 plus delta P. And Px, therefore, is d delta P dx. This is small, first order.（那真是非常幸运。但如果你讨论三体问题，你是无法解决的。它没有通用的解法。然而人们必须研究行星或月球的运动。那该怎么办呢？于是人们提出了摄动的概念。因此，摄动理论在18世纪得到了极大的发展，并且至今仍在不断完善。流体力学是一个非常复杂的学科，人们运用了各种不同的摄动思想。所以，摄动的精神是应用数学中普遍存在的一种精神。在这个特定的情况下，摄动理论非常简单。那么现在我们对P怎么办呢？我们把P写成P0加上ΔP。因此，Px就是dΔP/dx。这是一阶小量。）


Now P is a function of rho. When air vibrates, if there's a local increase of density, then locally the pressure would increase. So let us assume that pressure is a function of rho.There's some certainty about this, so we'll come to that. P is a function of rho, so therefore P of dP dx is equal to dP d rho, d rho dx. Now d rho dx is small.dP d rho is not small. So if we do it first order, it becomes like this. So this can be written as dP dx d rho.This is called compressibility. Plus rho x. This is small. So this equation becomes dP d rho zero.This has nothing to do with sound waves. This has nothing to do with sound waves. This is the pressure.This is the compressibility of the mass.（现在P是ρ的函数。当空气振动时，如果局部密度增加，那么局部压力也会增加。因此我们假设压力是ρ的函数。这一点是确定的，稍后会详细说明。既然P是ρ的函数，那么dP/dx就等于(dP/dρ)(dρ/dx)。现在dρ/dx很小，而dP/dρ不小。如果我们进行一阶近似，就得到这样的表达式。因此可以写成(dP/dx)(dρ)。这被称为压缩系数。加上ρx这一项（这一项很小）。于是这个方程就简化为dP/dρ_0。这与声波无关。这与声波无关。这是压力。这是质量的压缩性。）


When the density changes, how does the pressure increase? So this becomes rho x times rho zero u t equals zero. This equation now looks very nice because first, this is a number.It doesn't depend on P. It doesn't depend on T. It doesn't depend on x. This is a number. This is a number. So these coefficients are all numbers.And what we have are these first order relations. Now if I take the derivative of this one, I take u rho zero u tT is equal to minus dP d rho zero rho xt from the first equation. Now from the second equation, this is equal to minus dP d rho zero of rho zero uxx plus.So we get u tT is equal to dP d rho zero uxx. This is our old friend, the wave equation and the velocity.（当密度变化时，压力如何增加？因此这就变成了ρx乘以ρ0ut等于零。这个方程现在看起来非常简洁，因为首先，这是一个数值。它不依赖于P，不依赖于T，也不依赖于x。这是一个常数。这也是一个常数。所以这些系数都是常数。而我们得到的是这些一阶关系式。现在，如果我对这个式子求导，根据第一个方程可得ρ0utT等于负的dP/dρ0乘以ρxt。根据第二个方程，这等于负的dP/dρ0乘以ρ0uxx加上...因此我们得到utT等于dP/dρ0乘以uxx。这正是我们熟悉的老朋友——波动方程及其波速。）

This is the equation 18-3 in the book. Only it's written in a very peculiar form in the book. So that's the sound velocity. Let me say again, dp d rho is a property of the air. When you increase air density, its pressure increases. But now we want to introduce another concept. It's called adiabatic. In the sound propagation, in this analysis, when sound waves compress, when the sound wave propagates, there's a local change of density. So air is all the time being compressed and decompressed and so on and so forth.In that process, there's no heat flow. When sound waves compress air, there is no heat flow. No heat flow because heat flow is very slow.（这是书中的方程18-3，只不过它在书中的写法非常奇特。这就是声速。让我再说一遍，dp/dρ是空气的一个属性。当你增加空气密度时，它的压力也会增加。但现在我们要引入另一个概念，叫做绝热。在声传播的分析中，当声波压缩时，当声波传播时，密度会发生局部变化。因此空气一直在被压缩和膨胀，如此往复。在这个过程中，没有热流。当声波压缩空气时，没有热流。没有热流是因为热流非常缓慢。）

And when there's no heat flow, it's called adiabatic. The process is called adiabatic. So dp d rho is evaluated for an adiabatic compression.So normally this should be written as adiabatic. Let's try the dimension here. Let's look at dp d rho, the dimension of dp d rho.This notation means dimension. What is the dimension of pressure? Pressure is force per unit area. The dimension of force per unit area is like this.Rho is mass per unit volume. Force is mass times acceleration. Mass times length times time squared.And this is L and this is M. These are all eliminated. So it's L squared over T squared. So it's equal to V squared.So that's right. You should look at table 18E. It tells you the velocity.（当没有热流时，称为绝热过程。这个过程被称为绝热过程。因此，dp/dρ是在绝热压缩条件下求得的。通常这应该写作绝热。让我们在这里尝试一下量纲。让我们看看dp/dρ的量纲。这个符号表示量纲。压力的量纲是什么？压力是单位面积上的力。单位面积上的力的量纲是这样的。ρ是单位体积的质量。力等于质量乘以加速度。质量乘以长度除以时间的平方。这是L，这是M。这些都消去了。所以是L²/T²。所以等于V²。所以这是正确的。你应该查看表18E。它会告诉你速度。）

Air, usually V is equal to 331 meters per second. In water, if you compress the water, it's very resistant. So the velocity is much larger.Velocity is 14 bar meters per second. Steel, it's harder to compress. So it's 5941.That increasing is perfectly in agreement with our daily experience. So, I want you in the last 20 minutes to learn two things. First, these two equations, these two fundamental equations.One is the equation of continuity. The other is the equation which balances pressure force on one side and the momentum change on the other side. And I also want you to learn how to deal with such an equation by perturbation.Such an equation is very complicated. It's not linear.（空气，通常V等于每秒331米。在水中，如果你压缩水，它的阻力很大。所以速度要大得多。速度是每秒14巴。钢，更难压缩。所以是5941。这种增加完全符合我们的日常经验。所以，我希望你们在最后的20分钟里学会两件事。首先，这两个方程，这两个基本方程。一个是连续性方程。另一个是平衡一侧的压力和另一侧的动量变化的方程。我还希望你们学会如何通过微扰来处理这样的方程。这样的方程非常复杂。它不是线性的。）


But by thinking of things in perturbation orders and just neglect the higher order terms, you get a linear equation, and therefore it becomes a wave equation.So that spirit of doing perturbation is something that you will be learning repeatedly if you want to become a physicist, also if you want to become an engineer. The phenomenon of interference you are very familiar with. You all know that if you have water waves, if you have two sources of water waves, then they interfere.So, just read the book here. For traveling waves, like sound waves, the usual sound waves, there is energy generated by the motion. The small vibrations generate energy, and it flows.（但通过将事物按微扰阶数来考虑并忽略高阶项，你会得到一个线性方程，因此它就变成了波动方程。这种微扰处理的思想，如果你想成为一名物理学家或工程师，将会反复学习到。干涉现象你们非常熟悉。大家都知道，如果有水波，如果有两个水波源，它们就会发生干涉。那么，这里就读一下书吧。对于行波，比如声波，普通的声波，运动会产生能量。微小的振动产生能量，并且能量会流动。）

In fact, you know if you have a very large loudspeaker, you can feel the force coming together with the sound. And the book gives a sort of a half-derivation. So I will not go into that in detail.Read that section. It's 18.27. Rho V. V is the velocity. Omega is the angular frequency squared.SM squared is the maximum vibrational amplitude. The air molecules in a, for example, in a loudspeaker, they are vibrating, and this is the amplitude of the vibration. There is a unit of sound volume.It's called decibels. The key formula is that the decibel scale is equal to 10 decibels times log to the base 10 of I over I0, where I0 is 10 to the minus 12 watt per meter squared.（事实上，你知道如果你有一个非常大的扬声器，你可以感受到力与声音一同传来。书中给出了某种半推导过程，我就不详细展开了。请阅读18.27那部分内容。ρV中的V代表速度，ω是角频率的平方，SM的平方表示最大振动幅度。比如在扬声器中，空气分子在振动，这个数值就是它们的振动幅度。声音强度有个计量单位叫分贝，其核心公式为：分贝值=10分贝×以10为底的对数（I/I0），其中基准声强I0=10⁻¹²瓦特/平方米。）

This is a very useful section for you to read, because then you would know what is meant by 30 decibel sound volume or 50 decibels.If you have a pipe and the pipe, if both ends are sealed, closed pipe, the closed end means U is equal to 0. Here, the air can neither move forward nor backward, so U is equal to 0. The open end means DU DX is equal to 0. There is a maximum DU, a maximum U, a minimum DU DX. In this context, for example, read the derivations of 18-38 and 18-39. For different pipes, we had roughly talked about this.Both ends closed, you get the frequency distribution is one kind. One end closed, one end open is another kind. （这部分内容对你来说非常有用，因为它能让你理解30分贝或50分贝的音量具体意味着什么。假设你有一根管子，如果管子的两端都被密封，形成一个闭管，那么封闭端意味着U等于0。在这里，空气既不能向前也不能向后移动，因此U等于0。而开口端则意味着DU/DX等于0。这里存在一个最大的DU（即最大的U），以及一个最小的DU/DX。在这个背景下，例如，你可以参考推导18-38和18-39的内容。对于不同类型的管子，我们之前已经大致讨论过：两端封闭的管子会产生一种频率分布，而一端封闭、一端开放的管子则会产生另一种频率分布。）


Both ends open is a third kind.Suppose we have two frequencies, omega 1 and omega 2, with a small difference, omega 1 minus omega 2. Omega 1 minus omega 2 is much less than omega 1 and omega 2. So what is the sum? The sum is A cosine omega 1 t plus cosine omega 2 t. If the amplitudes of these two are different, the phenomenon of beat is not as clear. It's most clear if they are the same amplitude. Then you get the sum of the formula.You get 2 cosine omega 1 plus omega 2 t plus cosine omega 1 minus omega 2 t. Because that's cos, cos, minus, sin, sin, minus, sin, sin. And therefore the, no, one half, sorry. No, no, no, no. Complete wrong. That's not possible. It's equal to.This is not right.（两端开口是第三种情况。假设我们有两个频率ω₁和ω₂，且两者差值很小（ω₁ - ω₂），这个差值远小于ω₁和ω₂本身。那么它们的和是多少？和等于A乘以cos(ω₁t)加上cos(ω₂t)。如果这两个波的振幅不同，拍频现象就不明显。当振幅相同时现象最清晰，此时公式和为2cos[(ω₁ + ω₂)t/2]乘以cos[(ω₁ - ω₂)t/2]。因为根据余弦定理...不对等等，应该是...啊说错了。这个推导有问题。这个等式不成立。）

Now, this is still almost the same frequency. If omega 1 and omega 2 are about the same.This one, however, has a very small frequency. So this frequency is like this. This is a very large frequency.So the result is like this. This is determined by this. This part vibrates inside.From here to here, this is one frequency. So from here to here, it's 2 pi divided by one half omega 1 minus omega 2. This is time. From here to here, it's determined by this.This one cycle is 2 pi. So 2 pi divided by one half of the difference. So from here to here, it's half of it.In this situation, the way you hear is this beat. This is called beat. And so what is this frequency? So the beat frequency is equal to 1 over 2 pi over delta omega.（现在，这仍然是几乎相同的频率。如果ω1和ω2大致相同。然而，这个频率非常小。所以这个频率是这样的。这是一个非常大的频率。因此，结果就是这样。这是由这个决定的。这部分在里面振动。从这里到这里，这是一个频率。所以从这里到这里，是2π除以二分之一（ω1 - ω2）。这是时间。从这里到这里，是由这个决定的。这一个周期是2π。所以2π除以差值的一半。所以从这里到这里，是它的一半。在这种情况下，你听到的是这种拍音。这被称为拍频。那么这个频率是多少？所以拍频等于1除以（2π/Δω）。）


So the beat frequency is equal to f1 minus f2. Then there's a factor of 2. It's because from here to here, it's shortened to this. The beat.If there's a sound wave moving in the air, it's like this. These are the wave fronts. You can hear it here.If this person is moving, then it's obvious. If this person is moving in the opposite direction, the frequency he hears is bigger. If he's moving in the opposite direction, the frequency he hears is smaller.Similarly, if the source is moving, then this whole thing has an additional velocity due to the motion of the source. So this is called Doppler effect. It was discovered in the mid-19th century.I'm sure you have learned it in high school. So the new frequency is equal to the old frequency.（所以拍频等于f1减去f2。然后这里有个系数2。这是因为从这里到这里，它被缩短成这样。拍频。如果有声波在空气中传播，就是这样。这些是波前。你在这里能听到。如果这个人移动，那就很明显了。如果这个人朝相反方向移动，他听到的频率会变大。如果他朝相反方向移动，他听到的频率会变小。类似地，如果声源在移动，那么整个情况会因为声源的运动而有一个额外的速度。这就是所谓的多普勒效应。它是在19世纪中叶被发现的。我相信你在高中时学过这个。所以新的频率等于旧的频率。）


The new V plus, plus minus V detector, D-degree detector, V plus minus VS, S should be the source.I know that you have all learned in high school already. Suppose there's an object which moves faster than the velocity of sound. Then, when it's moving at this point, the sound comes out.After one second, the velocity moves. But it's already here. The supersonic airplane is like this.So this creates a shock wave. Because at the next moment, when it's here, it's smaller. When it's here, this shock wave is the angle.This velocity is the velocity of sound. This velocity is the velocity of the airplane. So this distance is the V source.Under this condition, you see this is a triangle.（新型V加减探测器，D度探测器，V加减VS，S应为声源。我知道你们在高中都已经学过。假设有一个物体以超过声速的速度移动。那么，当它移动到这一点时，声音发出。一秒钟后，速度移动。但它已经到达这里。超音速飞机就是这样。因此会产生冲击波。因为在下一刻，当它到达这里时，冲击波更小。当它到达这里时，这个冲击波的角度就是这样的。这个速度是声速。这个速度是飞机的速度。所以这段距离就是V源。在这种情况下，你可以看到这是一个三角形。）


So sine of theta is equal to V divided by V source. If it moves one more minute, the airplane will become like this.So there's a way to detect the shock wave. The shock wave moves like this. When a very fast jet plane goes through, you can hear this very sharp motion.The hydrodynamics of shock wave is a very, very important subject. It's a subject which especially became important because of the war. Okay, we have more or less gone through the mechanics part of the book.Before we embark on the next chapters, these are thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, we have to review a little bit. What we have learned so far, something like nine weeks or ten weeks, consists of material that you already knew, most of you, from high school physics.（因此，θ的正弦等于V除以V源。如果再移动一分钟，飞机就会变成这样。所以有一种方法来检测冲击波。冲击波是这样移动的。当一架非常快的喷气式飞机飞过时，你可以听到这种非常尖锐的运动。冲击波的流体力学是一个非常非常重要的课题。这个课题尤其因为战争而变得重要。*好的，我们或多或少已经完成了这本书的力学部分*。在我们开始下一章之前，这些是热力学和统计力学，我们必须稍微复习一下。到目前为止，我们已经学习了大约九周或十周的内容，这些内容你们大多数人已经从高中物理中了解过了。）


But we have also learned a number of things which are not in high school physics.I thought about it this morning, and I'm going to write them down. Moment of inertia. We went much more deeply into the subject of moment of inertia.Especially we said that if you have a body, a complicated rigid body, it has three principal axes of inertia, and with three principal moment of inertia, I1, I2, I3, and I1, I2, I3 may not be the same. And that's a very complicated subject. Rotation of gyroscope, planetary motion, damped harmonic oscillator, stream motion, wave equation, sound waves, sound wave equation.Six. These six topics are what are usually not contained in high school physics.（但我们还学到了一些高中物理中没有的内容。今天早上我思考了一下，决定把它们记下来。首先是转动惯量。我们对转动惯量这个主题进行了更深入的探讨。特别是我们提到，如果一个物体，一个复杂的刚体，它有三个主惯性轴，以及三个主转动惯量，I1、I2、I3，而且I1、I2、I3可能并不相同。这是一个非常复杂的课题。接下来是陀螺仪的旋转、行星运动、阻尼谐振子、流体运动、波动方程、声波、声波方程。这六个主题通常不在高中物理课程中出现。）


I know that some of you got a bit discouraged when you all of a sudden learned something which is a bit complicated.Okay. In order to know how you feel about this, for those who are uncomfortable with the topic of moment of inertia, raise your hand. Everyone understands? I'm surprised.I thought many people feel uncomfortable about these three moment of inertia. It's very simple now. I would like to ask Mr. Ruan and Mr. An to help me. My question is that what percentage of people think that moment of inertia is a kind of feeling that makes them feel uncomfortable? I asked them and they didn't raise their hands. So everyone is very happy, right? （我知道你们当中有些人突然学到一些有点复杂的内容时会感到有点沮丧。好吧，为了了解你们对此的感受，对于对转动惯量这个话题感到不适应的同学，请举手。大家都明白了吗？我很惊讶。我以为很多人会对这三个转动惯量感到不适应。现在很简单了。我想请阮先生和安先生帮我。我的问题是，有多少比例的人认为转动惯量是一种让他们感到不适应的感觉？我问了他们，他们没有举手。所以大家都很开心，对吧？）


OK, I see.Rotational gyroscope is more complicated. There are more people who are not happy. Rotational gyroscope is not very important.You will learn it in the future. Planetary motion. People say that planetary motion is an ellipse.It is a parabola, a hyperbola. Those derivations are very unhappy. Not many people are unhappy, right? Good.Bent harmonic oscillator. I think this is relatively simple. Maybe some of you already learned it in high school.Stream motion wave equation. So everyone is very happy, right? The most important thing is that I want to know with these more advanced ideas which are actually very simple.（好的，我明白了。旋转陀螺仪比较复杂。不满意的人更多。旋转陀螺仪不是很重要。你以后会学到的。行星运动。人们说行星运动是椭圆。它是抛物线，双曲线。那些推导过程很不愉快。不满意的人不多，对吧？很好。弯曲谐振子。我觉得这个相对简单。也许你们中有些人已经在高中就学过了。流运动波动方程。所以大家都很开心，对吧？最重要的是我想知道这些更高级的概念，其实非常简单。）


You will be learning those things or things like that repeatedly in the next three years.So I'm only exposing you to them now. If you feel very uncomfortable, that's not good. If you feel a little bit uncomfortable, it's fine.Because upon first learning something, it's natural to feel a little bit uncomfortable. But next time you see the same thing, you will feel much more comfortable. I don't know if it's because you are too shy to raise your hand or because you feel that you have learned a lot of these things so you are very happy.Okay, I will change this question. Does anyone want to spend another hour reviewing the previous six subjects? Which one are you advocating? （在接下来的三年里，你会反复学习这些或类似的内容。所以我现在只是让你们先接触一下。如果你感到非常不适应，那就不太好了。如果只是稍微有点不适应，那没关系。因为初次学习新事物时，感到些许不适应是很自然的。但下次再见到同样的内容时，你就会感觉自在多了。我不知道是因为你太害羞不敢举手，还是因为你觉得自己已经学了很多这类内容所以很开心。好吧，我换个问题。有人想再花一个小时复习前六个主题吗？你建议复习哪一个？）

The first two. I don't understand.They said the first two. The first two. Someone said the last two.Someone advocated that we reviewed the moment of inertia and rotation of gyroscope. Does anyone else want to review other subjects? The last two. Stream motion and sound.I think it's like this. Planetary motion and damped harmonic oscillator seem to make everyone happier. Is it because many of you have learned more or less in high school? No.Is it because of some difficulties? For example, differentiating exponential. There is an I on it. This is a problem.This doesn't seem to be a problem. Okay. If you ask me, the most important thing of these subjects, the damped harmonic oscillator is very important because you are going to see it repeatedly.（前两个。我不明白。他们说前两个。前两个。有人说最后两个。有人建议我们复习一下陀螺仪的转动惯量和旋转。还有人想复习其他内容吗？最后两个。流体运动和声学。我觉得是这样。行星运动和阻尼谐振子似乎让大家更开心。是因为你们中许多人在高中或多或少学过一些吗？不是。是因为有些难点吗？比如，指数函数的微分。上面有个I。这是个问题。这似乎不是问题。好吧。如果问我这些内容中最重要的，阻尼谐振子非常重要，因为你们会反复遇到它。）


But I'm also sure that that's the easiest for you to learn. The last two subjects, the wave equations, that's very important, and you'll be seeing that repeatedly. So I'll be very happy to review that with you.The first two, about the moment of inertia and rotation of gyroscopes. The problem with the rotation of gyroscopes is very complicated because the mathematics is complicated and it's not completely solved. The general problem is just two complicated nonlinear differential equations.But the moment of inertia is actually very, very simple. You merely have to get acquainted with matrices. And that you have to learn because you will be learning quantum mechanics.（但我也确信这对你来说是最容易学习的部分。最后两个主题，波动方程，非常重要，你会反复接触到它们。所以我很乐意和你一起复习这部分内容。前两个主题，关于转动惯量和陀螺仪的旋转。陀螺仪的旋转问题非常复杂，因为涉及的数学很复杂，而且这个问题还没有完全解决。一般的问题只是两个复杂的非线性微分方程。但转动惯量实际上非常简单。你只需要熟悉矩阵运算。这是你必须掌握的，因为你将会学习量子力学。）


And if you do not feel comfortable with matrices, you cannot learn quantum mechanics. So, okay. So we'll review the moment of inertia and review the stream motion and the sound motion.I think all of you are learning linear algebra, right? Have you gotten to diagonalization of square matrices? No. Yes. The discomfort that some of you feel about the moment of inertia is because you are not familiar with the concept of matrices.The concept of matrices is extremely simple. And it's just because you have not been exposed to it. And after you are exposed to it for a while, you'll know that it's very simple and it's essential.Both for physics and for mathematics. （如果你对矩阵感到不自在，你就无法学习量子力学。所以，好吧。我们会复习转动惯量，复习流运动和声运动。我想你们都在学习线性代数，对吧？你们学过方阵的对角化了吗？没有。有。你们中一些人对转动惯量感到不适，是因为你们不熟悉矩阵的概念。矩阵的概念极其简单。只是因为你还没有接触过它。等你接触一段时间后，你就会知道它非常简单，而且至关重要。无论是对于物理学还是数学来说都是如此。）


Okay, so we'll spend the next ten minutes reviewing something about matrices. To talk about the moment of inertia, we have to write some matrices.The matrices are like this. This is x i, y i, z i. Write it as a column. And then write it as x i, y i, z i. Write it as a row.When you multiply it, it becomes x i squared. x i, y i, x i, z i. This is y i, x i, z i, x i. And then this is y i squared, y i, z i, z i, y i, z i squared. This is... And then if you multiply it by m i, then the sum... This matrix is deeply related to the moment of inertia matrix.The trick is that you can turn a coordinate system. You don't have to... You can just find an x, y, z and write it. You don't have to use this x, y, z. You can find a system such that this evaluation can become a diagonal.（好的，接下来我们将用十分钟时间复习一下关于矩阵的内容。谈到转动惯量时，我们需要写出一些矩阵。矩阵的形式是这样的：这是x_i、y_i、z_i，写成列向量；然后再写成x_i、y_i、z_i的行向量。当它们相乘时，会得到x_i的平方、x_i y_i、x_i z_i；这是y_i x_i、z_i x_i；然后是y_i的平方、y_i z_i、z_i y_i、z_i的平方。这个矩阵...如果再乘以m_i，求和后...这个矩阵与转动惯量矩阵密切相关。关键在于你可以旋转坐标系——不必拘泥于原有坐标系，你可以重新选择x、y、z轴来表述，只要找到一个能使该矩阵对角化的坐标系即可。）


Diagonal means that there is no sum. There is only a diagonal element. That's the fundamental point.No matter how the rigid body looks, there always exists one axis, x, y, z, such that using that axis, this sum becomes diagonal. That axis is called... Those around the center of mass. That axis is called principal axis of inertia.To prove that, it depends on a simple theorem. There is an orthogonal transformation. Diagonalize this thing.What is orthogonal transformation? If this matrix is called A, this sum is called A. Of course, every point is a complicated sum. This A is equal to this sum. It's a matrix.This A has a diagonalization. Such that the existing orthogonal matrix becomes 0, 0, 0. These three are our diagonals.（对角意味着没有求和。只有对角元素存在。这是基本要点。无论刚体看起来如何，总存在一个轴，x、y或z，使得使用该轴时，这个求和变为对角。该轴称为...围绕质心的那些轴。该轴称为惯性主轴。为了证明这一点，依赖于一个简单的定理。存在一个正交变换。将这个矩阵对角化。什么是正交变换？如果这个矩阵称为A，这个求和称为A。当然，每个点都是一个复杂的求和。这个A等于这个求和。它是一个矩阵。这个A有一个对角化。使得存在的正交矩阵变为0、0、0。这三个就是我们的对角元素。）


This is the theorem.The interpretation of this theorem, or its meaning, is that there is a gamma. Mathematically, there exists an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1 such that it can be used to diagonalize this. The meaning of it is that in that system, there is a system obtained by using the gamma to transform the coordinate.In that system, if you do the evaluation just now, automatically it is diagonal. So that system is principal axis of inertia. So the most important concept is this theorem.What I want to ask now is whether you can prove this theorem or you don't know the meaning of this theorem. Which one is the thing that is difficult to swallow? I think they are all simple.（这就是该定理。这个定理的解释，或者说它的含义，是说存在一个伽马。从数学上讲，存在一个行列式为1的正交矩阵，可以用来对角化这个矩阵。它的意义在于，在那个系统中，有一个通过使用伽马变换坐标得到的系统。在那个系统中，如果你进行刚才的评估，它自动就是对角化的。所以那个系统就是惯性的主轴。因此，最重要的概念就是这个定理。我现在想问的是，你是否能证明这个定理，或者你不理解这个定理的含义。哪一个是你难以接受的？我认为它们都很简单。）

You have not seen it before.About how to prove this theorem, it's a trick. In general, many proofs are unimportant because you don't need to remember the proofs. But in this case, it's good to know the proof because the proof teaches you something.Once you know this proof, you realize the geometrical meaning of what you do. What do I mean? To prove this theorem, any symmetrical real matrix can be transformed into a big I by using a gamma tilde. How to prove this theorem? First, use the eigenvalue.First, take the determinant of A minus lambda I. You don't know the determinant is zero. After the determinant is zero, you get the idea of the eigenvalue.（你以前没见过这个。关于如何证明这个定理，其实有个小技巧。一般来说，很多证明并不重要，因为你不需要记住它们。但在这种情况下，了解这个证明很有好处，因为它能让你学到一些东西。一旦你知道了这个证明，你就会明白你所做事情的几何意义。我指的是什么？为了证明这个定理，任何对称实矩阵都可以通过使用伽玛波浪号转化为一个大I。如何证明这个定理呢？首先，使用特征值。首先，取A减去λI的行列式。你并不知道行列式为零。当行列式为零后，你就得到了特征值的概念。）

What is the determinant? The absolute value is the determinant.The determinant is zero, which means there is a psi. There exists a psi. This psi is called the eigenvector.This idea is important. If you don't know this, you can't study quantum mechanics. This is the first step of quantum mechanics.It's called the eigenvector. Once you have this eigenvector, you can write A psi equals lambda psi. This is it.Then you take this psi. There are three eigenvectors, so there are three eigenvalues, so there are three eigenvectors. If you connect the three eigenvectors, you get gamma.This idea is extremely important. Let me give you two days. （什么是行列式？绝对值就是行列式。行列式为零，意味着存在一个ψ。存在一个ψ。这个ψ被称为特征向量。这个概念很重要。如果你不知道这个，你就无法学习量子力学。这是量子力学的第一步。它被称为特征向量。一旦你有了这个特征向量，你就可以写出Aψ等于λψ。就是这样。然后你取这个ψ。有三个特征向量，所以有三个特征值，所以有三个特征向量。如果你把这三个特征向量连接起来，就得到了γ。这个概念极其重要。我给你两天时间。）


The first question is why there are three moments of inertia and three principal axes, and how to prove that the orthogonal matrix can be diagonalized.The real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized. You can review this. Also, you can review how we derived the string to become the wave equation.Also, you can review how we proved the hydrodynamics equation to become the sound wave. Go back and review this. If you have some fundamental questions, raise it next time.I think this review may be useful to many of you. OK, bye-bye.（第一个问题是为什么有三个转动惯量和三个主轴，以及如何证明正交矩阵可以对角化。实对称矩阵可以对角化。你可以复习一下这个。另外，你也可以复习一下我们是如何将弦推导成波动方程的。还有，你也可以复习一下我们是如何证明流体动力学方程变成声波的。回去复习一下这些。如果你有一些基本问题，下次提出来。我认为这个复习对你们很多人可能有用。好的，再见。）
