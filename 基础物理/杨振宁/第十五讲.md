The results of the Qizhong test were very good.and perhaps talk to Professor Rang or Professor An about how you could do better later on this semester. It's clear that the average score of Tsinghua students is much better than my students at Stony Brook. So I'm pleased about that.（期中测试的成绩很好，大部分人成绩在 70-100 之间，平均分是 86，那些不到 70 分的同学，或许你可以和冉教授或安教授谈谈这学期后期如何做得更好。显然，清华大学学生的平均成绩比我石溪分校的学生要好得多。对此我感到很高兴。）


Today's first topic is gravity inside Earth. We talked about the shell theorem last time. That is, if you consider the gravity due to this shell at a point inside the Earth, there is no force on it. Now for the next shell, there's also no force. So that means all the material in the Earth outside of this circle together have no gravity on this point. The gravity on that point is due to all the material inside of that radius.So this gravity at all equal to gravity due to the material inside the sphere of radius R. Now, that material has a mass of is equal to 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. Well, we are assuming a uniform sphere. This is not true, but let us assume it's a uniform sphere.The volume of the sphere is 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. If rho is the density, then that material has a mass of this amount. （今天的第一个主题是地球内部的重力。我们上次讨论了壳层定理。也就是说，如果你考虑地球内部某一点由这个壳层产生的重力，那么该点不受力。现在来看下一个壳层，同样没有力。这意味着地球在这个圆圈之外的所有物质对这个点都没有引力作用。该点的引力完全来自于该半径以内的所有物质。因此，这个引力等于半径为R的球体内物质产生的引力。现在，假设这是一个均匀球体（虽然实际情况并非如此），该球体的体积为4π/3乘以R的立方。如果ρ表示密度，那么这部分物质的质量就等于这个体积乘以密度。）

这部分物质的质量：$\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \cdot \rho$


By the shell theorem, our external points, the gravitational force at O is equal to all that mass being concentrated at the center.So it's equal to minus g times m. So m is the mass at this point times this density, this mass, divided by R cubed, divided by R squared. This is g m, capital M, divided by R squared. And that is, of course, equal to something, something, something times R. A constant times R. So we now have the conclusion.Inside the Earth, the gravitational force is proportional to R. （根据壳层定理，对于外部点 O 而言，引力等效于所有质量集中于中心点所产生的效果。因此引力等于负g乘以m。这里的m是该点的质量乘以密度（即此处的质量），再除以R的立方，然后除以R的平方。这相当于g乘以大写的M（总质量）除以R的平方。显然，这个结果等于某个常数乘以R。于是我们得出重要结论：在地球内部，引力大小与距离R成正比。）

$O$ 点出小 $m$ 所受到的引力：$$=-\frac{Gm\left( \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho \right)}{r^2}=-(\text{something})\cdot r$$
It's equal to zero at the center, obviously, because at the center it's spherically symmetrical. There's no force in any direction. But as you go away from it, the attractive force becomes larger and larger, proportional to R, until you reach this point.关于这一点有没有问题? （在中心处显然等于零，因为在中心处是球对称的。任何方向都没有力。但随着你远离中心，吸引力会越来越大，与R成正比，直到你到达这一点。关于这一点有没有问题？)

Now we talk about Section 10-6, Gravitational Potential Energy. 引力的位能,potential energy是未能。 We want to prove that the potential energy is equal to minus g m m. 大m是,小m是,大m是sun,小m是earth. 我们先take one dimension.（现在我们讨论第10-6节，引力势能。引力的位能，potential energy 是位能（我们一般称为势能，势能就是与位置相关的能）。我们要证明势能等于负g m m。大M是太阳，小m是地球。我们先取一维情况。）

我们要证明的是引力势能：$$U=-\frac{GMm}{r}$$其中 $M$ 是太阳，$m$ 是地球。


假如u是这样子的话, 我们从前说这个force是等于 minus du dr. 我们从前说这个,就是 just a second. This is equal to g m m r squared.Let's see, something's wrong. First, there's a minus here, here, there's a minus sign here, and d dr, d dr, get the minus sign. So this is right.所以,假如你u可以这样子的话, 这个force是等于这个,correct. 所以,u等于这是correct. 这是一个one-dimensional problem.How about the three-dimensional? Three-dimensional的话,要用所谓partial differentiation. Three-dimensional的时候, 然后,这个u是等于minus g m m r, 现在是x squared加y squared加z squared. 现在是three-dimensional了。 （如果U是这样的，我们之前说过这个力等于负的dU/dr。我们之前说过这个，就是——稍等。这等于G M m / r²。让我看看，好像有点问题。首先这里有个负号，这里，这里有个负号，然后d/dr，d/dr，得到这个负号。所以这是对的。所以，如果你的U可以是这样，这个力就等于这个，正确。所以U等于这个是正确的。这是一个一维问题。三维情况呢？三维的话要用所谓的偏微分。在三维情况下，这个U等于负的G M m / r，现在r是x² + y² + z²。现在是三维了。）

在一维情况下，由于：$$F=-\frac{\partial U}{\partial r}=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
所以上述关于 $U$ 公式结论成立。

而在三维情况下，需要偏微分，$$U=-\frac{GMm}{\sqrt{ x^2+y^2+z^2 }}$$

那么,对于x,y,z,你要differentiate的时候, 叫做partial differentiation, that means, when you differentiate relative to x, you consider y and z as fixed.When you differentiate with respect to y, you consider x and z as fixed. So, this notation叫做force,是一个vector, 是du dx,minus du dx, minus du dy, minus du dz. 这个notation是叫partial differentiation.这里有一个平常的这个叫做gradient, 三角形加一个箭头的意思, 就是三个partial differentiation, partial x, partial y, partial z. OK,我们来试一下。 假如我们take这个的话, 那么,du dx是等于minus g m m, 乘上du d这个square root, 然后,d这个square root,dx。 （那么，对于x、y、z进行微分时，就叫做偏微分。也就是说，当你对x微分时，要把y和z视为常数；当你对y微分时，要把x和z视为常数。这个记号叫做力，是一个矢量，即du/dx、-du/dx、-du/dy、-du/dz。这个记号称为偏微分。这里有个常用的符号叫梯度，用倒三角形加箭头表示，就是三个偏微分：∂/∂x、∂/∂y、∂/∂z。好，我们来试一下。如果我们取这个的话，那么du/dx等于负g乘以m乘以m，再乘以du/d这个平方根，然后d这个平方根/dx。）


这就是所谓chain rule, 你在differentiate的时候, 这是minus g m m, 那du d这个东西呢, 这u是1 over r, du d 1 over r, 这个minus 1 over r squared, 所以这个是minus 1 over, d这个square root,dx呢, 是等于二分之一的square root, 二分之一,1 over square root, 乘上d这个square root, d这个square root的inside, 就是x squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 因为这是中间的东西的二分之一, 所以dsquare root of一个something, 是等于二分之一的1 over square root of that thing, 乘上d它里头的,所以就变成这个。 对不起。 这还要乘上dx squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 这个算了一顿以后, 就得出来g m m r squared, 乘上x over r。 （这就是所谓的链式法则。当你进行微分时，这里是负的g m m。那么du d这个东西呢，u等于1除以r，du d(1/r)就是负的1除以r的平方，所以这里是负的1除以... d这个平方根，dx等于二分之一乘以平方根，也就是二分之一乘以1除以平方根，再乘以d这个平方根内部的内容，即x平方加y平方加z平方，关于dx的微分。因为这是中间步骤的二分之一，所以d(某物的平方根)等于二分之一乘以1除以该物的平方根，再乘以d该物内部的微分，于是就得到了这个结果。抱歉，这里还需要乘以dx平方加y平方加z平方关于dx的微分。经过这一系列计算后，最终得到g m m除以r平方，乘以x除以r。）


所以你这样算出来这个f, 就等于g m m over r squared, 有个负号,因为这有个负号, 乘上x over r,同样y over r,z over r, 它是三个component。 这个间线呢,就变成minus g m m over r squared, 乘上r over r。 这是什么意思呢? 这个是the force, r over r是unit vector along the r direction, 所以比如说是, 这空间有一点, 这个unit vector是r over r, 因为r over r当然是在r direction, 它的magnitude是1, 所以这是unit vector。 那所以这个force是对的。 Correct. In other words, we have proven that u是等于这个。 在three dimension的时候,u也是对的。 这个formula可以记得。（所以你这样算出来这个力f，就等于g m m除以r的平方，有个负号（因为这里有个负号），乘以x除以r，同理y除以r，z除以r，这是它的三个分量。这个中间步骤呢，就变成了负的g m m除以r的平方，乘以r向量除以r。这是什么意思呢？这个力，r向量除以r是沿r方向的单位向量。比如说，空间中有个点，这个单位向量就是r向量除以r，因为r向量除以r自然是在r方向上，其模长为1，所以是单位向量。因此这个力是正确的。没错。换句话说，我们已经证明了u等于这个。在三维情况下，u也是正确的。这个公式可以记下来。）

所以这个force是可以写成这样。 Conservation of energy. 我们现在有这个formula, F是等于minus gradient of u, gradient的意思就是d dx,d dy,d dz, 可是我们知道这东西是等于m乘上r double dot, 这是Newton's law, 所以我把它用r dot, dot一下子, 我把它写成minus r dot, dot, 右边这是什么? 右边就等于d dt, of 1 over 2, m, r dot, dot r dot, 你同意不同意? Because if I differentiate this, I can differentiate this one first. Plus, I differentiate this one. Those terms would give you r dot dot r double dot. So that two cancels this two, so this is this.（所以这个力可以这样表示。能量守恒。我们现在有这个公式，F等于负的u的梯度，梯度的意思就是d/dx, d/dy, d/dz，但是我们知道这个东西等于m乘以r的二阶导数，这是牛顿定律，所以我用r的一阶导数来表示它，一下子写成负的r的二阶导数，右边是什么？右边等于d/dt，1/2乘以m，r的一阶导数点乘r的一阶导数，你同意吗？因为如果我对此求导，我可以先对这个求导。再加上，我对这个求导。这些项会给你r的一阶导数点乘r的二阶导数。所以这两个抵消了这两个，所以这个就是这个。）

And this is d dt of m v squared. That's our old friend, the kinetic energy. But what is the left side? The left side is minus d dr dt dot d dx plus.I write this explicitly, right? This is equal to minus x dot times du dx minus y dot du dy minus z dot du dz. Do you agree or disagree? Because that's what's meant by the dot product. Dot product means you write these three components down.X dot, y dot, z dot. The gradient is d dx, d dy, d dz. But once you have du dx, dx, dx, dt, du dy, dy, dy, this means minus du dt.（这是关于m v平方的d dt。那是我们的老朋友，动能。但左边是什么呢？左边是负的d dr dt点d dx加上。我写得明确些，对吧？这等于负的x点乘以du dx减去y点du dy减去z点du dz。你同意还是不同意？因为这就是点积的含义。点积意味着你把这三个分量写下来：x点、y点、z点。梯度是d dx、d dy、d dz。但一旦你有du dx、dx、dx、dt、du dy、dy、dy，这意味着负的du dt。）


So we have, so putting these two together, we get d dt of u plus kinetic energy. So u plus one half m v squared is equal to a constant. And that's usually called E total energy.This is, of course, something that we are familiar with. We have been familiar with already about the total conservation of energy. Now the only thing that's new is for the gravitational force.We know explicitly what the conservation, what the energy expression is. Is this U is a minus GMM divide by R. Any questions? （因此，将这两部分结合起来，我们得到d/dt(u + 动能)。即u + (1/2)mv²等于一个常数，这个常数通常被称为总能量E。当然，这是我们熟悉的概念，我们已经了解了能量守恒定律。现在唯一的新内容是针对引力的情况。我们明确知道守恒定律以及能量表达式的具体形式，即这里的U等于-GMM除以R。有什么问题吗？）


I'm going to talk about the escape velocity, neglect air resistance. So if on Earth, you put a rocket with velocity v, of course the rocket has to overcome the resistance of air.But let us neglect that. Let us assume that the satellite or the rocket is already above the Earth's atmosphere. Let's say above 50 kilometers, there is essentially no more atmosphere.Does anybody know how the atmosphere goes down when you go farther and farther away? I'm sure you know that as you go farther and farther away from the Earth, the air pressure becomes less and less.（我将要讨论逃逸速度，忽略空气阻力。所以如果在地球上，你以速度v发射一枚火箭，当然火箭必须克服空气的阻力。但让我们忽略这一点。让我们假设卫星或火箭已经在地球大气层之外。比如说在50公里以上，基本上就没有大气了。有人知道当你离地球越来越远时，大气是如何逐渐减少的吗？我相信你们都知道，随着你离地球越来越远，气压会变得越来越低。）


And it's a complicated phenomenon because there is also temperature. There is a temperature variation, but roughly when you go out, you know that the pressure decreases, essentially exponentially.It's about every five kilometers, the pressure becomes half. So if you go very far, there's no more air pressure. So now let us start from that point.If I shoot the rocket at that point out, if it's too slow, it will come down. It will be pulled down by Earth. The question is at what velocity would it escape?（这是一个复杂的现象，因为还涉及温度因素。温度会有所变化，但大致来说，当你向外太空行进时，气压会呈指数级下降——大约每上升五公里，气压就会减半。如果飞行距离足够远，气压最终会完全消失。现在让我们从这个临界点开始思考：如果我在这个临界点发射火箭，当速度不足时，火箭仍会被地球引力拉回。那么问题来了：究竟需要多大的初速度才能实现逃逸？）


Well, if it escapes, that means that because of the conservation of energy, that means that when it reaches infinity, it essentially has no more velocity.So if it escapes, then E equal to minus G M M over R plus one-half M V squared must be greater than zero. Because... Because at R equal to infinity, E... If it can escape, that means that when... There is no square. When it reaches infinity, potential energy is zero.Kinetic energy is positive. Kinetic energy is always positive, so the total energy has to be positive. But at zero, it just barely escapes.That means that if E is equal to zero, that means it will go out, and by the time it reaches infinity, it has slowed down to V equal to zero. So that velocity is the escape velocity. So E equal to zero gives escape velocity.And that, of course, is equal to 2 M 2 G M M. Yeah. In this case, M, that is the mass of Earth. Yeah, but the number of kilometers per second for Earth.And this number, if you estimate, is about a hundred times the speed of a car, of an ordinary car. But of course, if you send a rocket from the Earth, you must first have enough thrust to make it escape from the atmosphere. And then you have to have this speed before it can go out of the Earth's attraction.There's an R here, sorry. One of the most important events in the history of mankind is the understanding of planetary orbits by Newton. In China, the ancient philosophers did not have, from today's viewpoint, the correct view about the structure of the universe.The Greeks also had an incorrect view, but their way of thinking about it eventually led to Newton's discovery. First, in the Greek times, the most important person was Ptolemy. He lived in Greece from 90 to 168 AD.The way that he was thinking, and in fact the way all the Greeks were thinking, was that the Earth is at the center of the universe. And furthermore, they had the following feeling. They wanted to construct a universe which is most beautiful.Because they believed God must create a most perfect, most beautiful structure. And what is most beautiful? The circle is most beautiful. So they called it the harmony of circles.They thought that the Earth is at the center of the universe, and the stars, the planets, would all go around in circles. But that's not correct. By observation, they knew that, for example, the motion of Mars is very complicated.So they thought it's not a circle. The next complicated but beautiful thing is a circle on a circle. What is a circle on a circle? If you have a ball here, and a circle, while the center is moving in a big circle, there's a particle which goes around this, so you would get something like this.That's called circle on circle. And they tried to adjust the sizes of these two circles to make it match the motion of the planets. It didn't work.So they make it a circle on a circle on a circle. And since there are many planets, so there are many circles, and at one point, somebody had the complete structure of the planets' motion. There were 80 some circles.And that was the general way of thinking about planetary motion. Now why are planetary motions so very important? Because there's agriculture. When you develop agriculture, you know that agriculture depends on the understanding of the seasons.And understanding of the seasons depends on understanding of the motion of the stars around the Earth as you see them. So that astronomy is an important subject in every civilization. It's an obvious thing.Because if you develop agriculture, then astronomy becomes important. But there are regularities of the motion of the stars, of the planets. But there are also strange motions.So people began to try to puzzle out these strange motions. And therefore, this circle on circle on circle kind of idea. That held back Western astronomy for more than 2,000 years, until Copernicus.He advocated heliocenter theory. You all know that Galileo subscribed to this theory. Galileo believed in this theory and was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Nevertheless, many astronomers began to think about the heliocenter theory. The next important development was Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe was an observer.He made accurate measurements of the position of various planets year after year. And after he died, his data was analyzed by Kepler. So Brahe was an experimental astronomer.Kepler was a theoretical astronomer. It was very interesting how Kepler made his great discoveries. He concentrated on the motion of Mars.And the motion of Mars, according to Copernicus' idea, was mostly a circle. In fact, the orbit of Mars as we know it today is almost a circle. But because Brahe's data was very accurate, so Kepler was able to accurately map the position of Mars and found that it's not a circle.It doesn't fit a circle. It almost fits a circle, but not quite. And then one day he suddenly realized it's not a circle at all.It's an ellipse. This is one of the most important events in the history of mankind. The reason that he could land on the idea of an ellipse is also because the Greeks had studied ellipses in detail.We all know, and I'm sure you have learned, plane geometry, Euclid's geometry in high schools. But the Greeks developed geometry much more than Euclid. After Euclid, they studied what is called a conic section.A conic section is you take a cone, take a circular cone, and you can cut it. If you cut it this way, obviously it's a circle. If you cut it this way, it's an ellipse.So this way you get a circle. This way you get an ellipse. If you cut it this way, then it has two branches.One cut in the top, one cut in the bottom. You get a hyperbola. Circle is a circle.

Ellipse is a cone. Hyperbola is called a conic section. All of these curves, their relationship to each other, and their relationship to the cone, were studied in great detail.Beautiful work in Greek times after Euclid. And Kepler, being a theorist, knew these conic section results very well. That is perhaps the reason why it dawned on him one day that the reason that one cannot fit a circular orbit to the trajectory of Mars was because it's not a circle, it is an ellipse.And once that's done, he formulated the three laws. These laws, in today's language, are called empirical laws. Empirical means experimental.The first law is that planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. An ellipse always has two focuses. An ellipse has something called ellipticity.I think ellipticity is called ellipticity, right? Ellipticity. When this ellipticity is zero, it is a circle. When it is one, it is a parabola.When it is greater than one, it is a hyperbola. We'll come to this later. So the first law says that all planetary orbits are ellipses.And that was very accurately correct for a long time. Then, of course, when people had more accurate measurements, they found slight corrections to this. And that correction needed additional considerations.And that's outside of our discussion this semester. The second law says that a planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. This is what it means.When a planet is moving, for example, in one unit time, it has a small triangle. In another unit time, these triangles are in the same area. As it goes around.A planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. The way that he formulated this law shows that he was a very geometrical person. He evidently plotted the curves and observed that when the planet moves slower, that when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower.But this distance is longer, and this area becomes the same. So, when it comes to here, it moves very fast. But in the unit time, it still sweeps the same area.The third law says the period, cube, divided by... T is the period around the sun. A is the semi-major axis. From this point to this point, that distance is called 2A.Different satellites all around the same sun share the same value of T cubed divided by... T squared divided by A cubed. Sorry, T squared. Kepler died in the year 1630.A few years later, Newton was born. Newton explained. Newton was both an experimentalist and a theorist.He was a great experimentalist as well as a theorist. But perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind was his discovery of calculus, of the origin of the planetary motion,

The most important contribution of Newton was he explained the three laws, Kepler's three laws, through the theory of gravitation. These three laws are explained in the book, but it was too simple because it did not succeed in proving the three laws. We are now going to go through the proofs of all three laws.（牛顿最重要的贡献在于，他通过万有引力理论解释了开普勒三大定律。虽然书中对这些定律有所阐述，但过于简略，未能成功证明其正确性。现在我们将逐一推导这三条定律的证明过程。）

So first, proof of second law. The second law is the easiest to prove. We had the following theorem. Several weeks ago we had proven this theorem by straightforward differentiation. If this is the sun, and this is the earth, and this angle is theta, this distance is r. That's called polar coordinates. Using polar coordinates, we found that acceleration has two components.（首先，证明第二定律。第二定律是最容易证明的。我们有以下定理。几周前，我们通过直接微分证明了这个定理。如果这是太阳，这是地球，这个角度是θ，这个距离是r。这被称为极坐标。使用极坐标，我们发现加速度有两个分量。）

One is along the direction of r, the other is along the direction of theta. This is the direction of r, and the direction of theta is perpendicular to it. So let us apply Newton's law. Newton's law says that the force is equal to m a. You multiply this by m, should be equal to force. But the force is only in the r direction, so therefore the theta direction has to be equal to zero. In other words, Newton's law says two r dot theta dot plus r theta double dot is equal to zero.（一个是沿着r的方向，另一个是沿着θ的方向。这是r的方向，而θ的方向与之垂直。让我们应用牛顿定律。牛顿定律说力等于m乘以a。你把这个乘以m，应该等于力。但力只在r方向上，因此θ方向必须等于零。换句话说，牛顿定律说两个r点θ点加上rθ双点等于零。）

There's another. We also know that this acceleration, m times that, m times r double dot minus r theta dot squared, has to be equal to minus g m m over r squared. That's the meaning of f equal to m a. Okay, let's take out the first one.

That one means d dt of r squared theta dot. That's equal to two r r dot theta dot plus r squared theta double dot. Just by straight computation.

And that has to be equal to zero, because let's call this one, this two. Therefore, r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. r squared theta dot is equal to r times r theta dot is equal to a constant.

Now, this is r. This angle is r theta dot. r theta dot dt is this angle. Therefore, one half, but one half of r times r theta dot dt is equal to area swept.

Area swept in dt. This is equal to one half of r squared theta dot dt is equal to one half c dt. In other words, area swept in dt is a constant in dt, and that's second law, i.e. this area swept is proportional to dt.

It's a constant in dt. But r times r theta dot is also the angular momentum explanation. r times r theta dot is a constant.

It's equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. In other words, the second law of Kepler is nothing but the conservation of angular momentum. As long as the force is always along the direction of r, there is conservation of angular momentum, and then there is Kepler's second law.In other words, suppose the force is not one over r squared, it's one over r cubed, or anything, which depends only on r, but with no theta component, then second law always is correct, i.e. second law follows from angular momentum conservation plus central force. Central force means that the force is always directed to the center. In other words, no theta component.Next, we are going to prove the first law, but before we do that, let me box this equation. r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. Now we go to equation 2. Equation 2 becomes r double dot minus r theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.In fact, let's put m back in. I multiply both sides by r and integrate. I get m over r squared plus r squared theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.If I differentiate this, this becomes this, multiplied by r dot, and this becomes this. Let's forget about this. It's simpler that we directly use the energy law.

We know the energy. We have proven 20 minutes ago that the total energy is a kinetic energy, one half mv squared plus u, which is mmg over r. That is equal to a constant. This actually follows from this.

Only you integrate this, you multiply this by r dot and integrate, you get this expression. But since we have already the general statement, so we might as well start from here. This is the kinetic energy.

This is the potential energy. And that results equal to constant. We call it E. And again, we divide the case into E equal to zero, E greater than zero, or E less than zero.For a particle which can go to infinity, which can barely go to infinity, E is equal to zero. If E is greater than zero, that means that when r is infinity, this part is positive. So it can go to infinity with a finite velocity.If it is negative, this part cannot become zero, because if this part is zero, this is positive. If E is negative, that never happens. In other words, case one, E less than zero cannot escape.This is the case that we'll deal with first. Later on, we'll deal with E equal to zero and E greater than zero. So let us write E is equal to one-half of m. V squared is r dot squared plus r squared theta dot squared minus mg over r. r dot is equal to dr, dc, the dc, the dt.So I can write it this way. And therefore, this is equal to one-half of m dr d theta squared plus r squared times theta dot squared. But to see the dots, woman, but we have r squared theta dot equal to a constant.We have that formula before, according to the second law. So I can use that to eliminate theta dot. So this becomes c squared over r fourth.Let us now multiply this whole by r fourth. So we get E r fourth is equal to m over two. E is negative.So you will write minus a squared to be equal to 2E over mc squared. Note that E is negative, so I write minus a squared. B is equal to 2mg over c squared.I saw this equation many years ago, of course. So yesterday, I tried to solve this equation. The more I solved it, the more complicated it became.Later, after thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a trick. This trick is like this. You have to change a variable.If you want to use this r, you can take this r to the other side. Then open a square. Then you get dr d theta.And then you divide after you get theta. It's an integral over dr of a complicated expression. You can do it that way, too, but that's not an easy way.Then I remembered there was a trick. I don't know who first found the trick. Newton must have found the equivalent trick, but he did not write it in his book.The trick is to invert r. Put r equal to 1 over rho. Then dr d rho, dr d theta, becomes dr d rho, d rho d theta. But dr d rho is equal to 1 over rho squared.So we put that in there. You get 1 over rho fourth, d rho d theta squared, plus 1 over rho squared, is equal to minus a squared over rho fourth, plus b over rho cubed. You multiply by rho fourth.You get d rho d theta squared is equal to minus a squared, plus b rho, minus rho squared. The advantage of this compared with this, it's very similar. But here dr d theta has r squared term, r cubed term, r fourth term.In rho, it has become constant rho and rho squared. So this is simpler than this. And that's the trick.When you have something like this, the natural thing is to perfect the square. So this is a minus rho, minus b over 2 squared, plus b squared over 4. That takes care of these two terms, minus a squared. So let's call this sigma squared.So we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2, r by 1 over rho. Then this becomes b sigma d theta squared, is equal to minus sigma squared, plus k squared. Where we define k squared to be b squared over four minus a squared.How do I know it's a positive number and not a negative number? It can't be negative because the left side is positive. So unless this is positive, the equation doesn't make sense. When you have an equation like this, by inspection you know what to do.You should write sigma as k sine theta, sine phi. When you do that, d sigma d theta becomes k cosine phi d phi d theta squared. Is equal to k square minus k square sine square theta.A sine square phi, which is equal to k squared cosine square phi. The reason that we do this is because the k square cosine square phi cancels. So we get d phi d theta equal to 1. So d phi d theta is equal to plus minus 1. We need only a constant of d phi d theta equal to 1. So therefore, we can write phi is equal to theta plus a constant.So we put that back in. We get rho is equal to 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine of phi theta plus constant. The constant doesn't matter.All it means is you change the origin of theta. So I can make that constant equal to 0. So I would get 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine theta. I can write this as b over 2 times 1 plus e, where e is equal to k, 2k over b. It's 2 over b times k. k is square root of b squared over 4 minus a squared.So therefore, it's equal to square root of 1 minus 4a squared over b squared. And that is equal to square root of 1 minus 2c squared over m squared g squared times minus e over m. This is a very important quantity. It's called the eccentricity.It tells you how ellipse, how much it deviates from a circle. Let's look at the expression. It's the square root of 1 minus c. c is related to the angular momentum, how much it sweeps per unit time.m squared g squared are related to the mass of the sun and the gravitational constant. Minus e over m. e is the energy of the planet. That e is clearly proportional to m. In other words, if the Earth were twice as massive, you can think of it as two Earths stuck together.And each of them would still follow the same orbit. So therefore, e is always proportional to m. So e over m is the per unit mass energy for the planet. And we get this.And this is... We shall now show that it is an ellipse. It is an ellipse because this is another trick. When you have an equation which has r in it, you always follow what we are going to demonstrate as a trick.I take this formula and multiply both by r. So I get 1 is equal to b over 2 times r plus e times r sine theta. r sine theta is y. You have an equation which both has x, y, z in it and has r in it. The way to do it is to move everything to one side which does not contain r.

And then square it. In other words, you get 1 over B over 2EY is equal to B over 2R. Now I square both sides.

So I get 1 minus BEY plus B squared E squared Y squared over 4 is equal to B squared 4R squared, which is X squared Y squared. This way we get rid of the R. R has a square root and is not convenient. Now if you look at this, it is an ellipse.This E is less than 1. How do I know it's an ellipse? Because you know when you have a quadratic equation in X and Y, we'll show that this is an ellipse in a minute. Let us multiply this by 4 over B squared. Multiply it by 4 over B squared.I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B plus E squared Y squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared Y squared. I shall define this.Oh, sorry. I get 4B squared is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared times Y squared plus 4E divided by 1 minus E squared. 2E.

1 minus E squared Y squared plus. This is 2. 2EY. This is 2E.

2EY over B minus minus 4E squared over B squared or minus E squared. What I am doing here is to divide this into squares. I move this over here and divide it into squares.I shall now define an alpha. Let me see if I am doing this right or wrong. I shall now define an alpha.Square is equal to 4 over B squared. I shall now define an alpha. I shall now define an alpha.1 minus E squared. This is equal to alpha squared over 1 minus E squared. Where Y prime is equal to Y plus 2E.So you can see that this function is an X squared. 1 minus E squared is positive. So this is a typical ellipse.If you want to write it as a standard ellipse, you have to write it like this. You have to divide this whole thing by 2. This has now become a standard ellipse. I think you all recognize it.This number is bigger than this number. Because this is divided by 1 minus E squared. So its major axis is called A. Semi-major axis.So this ellipse is like this. Let me see if I am doing this right. Yes.Its semi-major axis is this A. It is equal to the square root of this thing. It is equal to alpha over 1 minus E squared. This is called A. Minor axis is called B. It is this distance.What is this equal to? It is equal to the square root of this. It is equal to alpha. It is QED.We have now proven that the orbit is an ellipse. Before the ellipse shifted, Y' then Y. Before the ellipse shifted, this is a center. This is a focus.We are not going to prove this. You can try it. It has a standard formula.You know the major axis and the minor axis. You know where the focus is. You will find that the focus is the shift from Y to Y' just now.Okay. Now we have the third law. Proof of the third law.The third law tells you that its period has something to do with its semi-major axis. We use its area. Area of ellipse.You know that the area of a circle is πr². If an ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis, a and b, its area is πab. If a is equal to b, it becomes πa².So we know that just now we have a major axis and a minor axis. So it is definitely α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Now, one half of r²θ' is equal to ddt of area swept.We have this formula before. Because this is r, this is rθ'dt. So one half of that is equal to area swept.One half of that is area swept per unit time. So if r²θ' is equal to 2c, then it is c over 2. Because r²θ' is equal to c. Therefore, the total area of the ellipse divided by the period is equal to this. Since this is per unit area, the total area divided by t is this.So we know that the total area is equal to tc over 2. But this is equal to α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. So we have this formula. We have calculated the period.The period is equal to 2 over c. The total area is equal to this π. πα² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Then we know that a is equal to α over 1 minus e². This is the formula we just had.So we can calculate t² over a³. After calculating this algebra for a long time, we can prove that this is equal to 4π² over mg. This is in the book.But the book doesn't prove this. Because the book doesn't talk about ellipse. It only talks about the circle case.Now we are proving that this is general. And this is of course the Kepler's third law. So t² over a³ is a constant which depends on the sun's mass.Different planets have the same constant. So we have proven all three all three Kepler's laws. Next time, we are going to discuss the other two cases.Namely, e is equal to 0 and e is greater than 0. I'll be in my class in my office this afternoon between 4 and 5. Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this. So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun...

Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1. The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery. Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established. 所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things? The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho. So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine. It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one.

And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week.

I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared.

So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared. And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious. 


Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. （好的，现在我们进入下一章。我们都知道有固体、液体和气体。这本书将后两者称为流体。流体的特性是没有剪切力。我们之前已经讨论过这一点。液体没有剪切力，也没有阻力。顺便说一下，我想介绍一下强度量和广延量的概念。我不知道“intensive”和“extensive”在中文里怎么说。）

Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive.

Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure. Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject. The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute. The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years.

began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity.

Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity. And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity.

He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy.

So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed.

That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found.

So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004.

There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery.

I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property.

And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery.

Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia.

We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid.

The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order.（固体可以有不同的相，因为它可以有不同的晶体结构。现在我们知道液体也可以有超相和非超相。而现在我们也知道固体可以有超相和非超相。所有这些都基于长程有序的概念。什么是长程有序？晶体具有长程有序。液体和气体则没有长程有序。）

Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order.

So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term.

It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order.

But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things.

I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order.

All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class.

I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here.

There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom.

The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface.

The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation.

So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top.

Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere.

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance.

You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil.

So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1.

But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2.

Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever. A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath.

If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area.（如果这两者的高度相同，那么压力也是相同的。所以如果我在这里施加一个压力P，那么这里的压力也是相同的。但如果这里的面积是A，这里的面积是A'，那么这里的总重量，这个重量，或者说这个重量就是PA'G。如果A'非常大，这里的总压力就是PAG，这个比例等于A'除以A。抱歉，没有G。因为两个压力相同，所以力与面积成正比。）

And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight.

But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance.

So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy.

But what you can magnify is the force. Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this.

I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng.

So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent.

So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this.

If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow.（如果他们施加的压力过大，水流就会变得湍急。你知道湍流是什么样子的。实际上，当水从水龙头流出时，如果流速过快，就会形成湍流。它会变得混乱。这种中国都流传。一个著名的问题是：在多大的压差或中心流速下，流动会从层流转变为湍流。）

This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem.（这是其中一个著名的问题，而这个问题至今仍在研究中。但中心的林教授（C.C. Lin）是该领域的早期重要贡献者之一。事情是这样的，在20世纪20年代，著名的海森堡——那个开创了量子力学的海森堡——在撰写他的博士论文时，就探讨了这个问题。）

He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work.（他是德国索末菲的学生。他们都是德国人，海森堡并没有写关于量子力学的论文。他写了一篇关于湍流的论文，并获得了博士学位，后来他成为了量子力学的伟大奠基者之一。但他的博士论文中关于层流转变为湍流的理论是否正确曾引发争议。大约20年后，当时的研究生林家翘撰写了论文，澄清了这一争议，在某种程度上很大程度上支持了海森堡的工作。）

Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube. So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow,

Plus, I differentiate this one. Those terms would give you r dot dot r double dot. So that two cancels this two, so this is this.

And this is d dt of m v squared. That's our old friend, the kinetic energy. But what is the left side? The left side is minus d dr dt dot d dx plus.I write this explicitly, right? This is equal to minus x dot times du dx minus y dot du dy minus z dot du dz. Do you agree or disagree? Because that's what's meant by the dot product. Dot product means you write these three components down.X dot, y dot, z dot. The gradient is d dx, d dy, d dz. But once you have du dx, dx, dx, dt, du dy, dy, dy, this means minus du dt.So we have, so putting these two together, we get d dt of u plus kinetic energy. So u plus one half m v squared is equal to a constant. And that's usually called E total energy.This is, of course, something that we are familiar with. We have been familiar with already about the total conservation of energy. Now the only thing that's new is for the gravitational force.We know explicitly what the conservation, what the energy expression is. Is this U is a minus GMM divide by R. Any questions? I'm going to talk about the escape velocity, neglect air resistance. So if on Earth, you put a rocket with velocity v, of course the rocket has to overcome the resistance of air.But let us neglect that. Let us assume that the satellite or the rocket is already above the Earth's atmosphere. Let's say above 50 kilometers, there is essentially no more atmosphere.Does anybody know how the atmosphere goes down when you go farther and farther away? I'm sure you know that as you go farther and farther away from the Earth, the air pressure becomes less and less. And it's a complicated phenomenon because there is also temperature. There is a temperature variation, but roughly when you go out, you know that the pressure decreases, essentially exponentially.It's about every five kilometers, the pressure becomes half. So if you go very far, there's no more air pressure. So now let us start from that point.If I shoot the rocket at that point out, if it's too slow, it will come down. It will be pulled down by Earth. The question is at what velocity would it escape? Well, if it escapes, that means that because of the conservation of energy, that means that when it reaches infinity, it essentially has no more velocity.So if it escapes, then E equal to minus G M M over R plus one-half M V squared must be greater than zero. Because... Because at R equal to infinity, E... If it can escape, that means that when... There is no square. When it reaches infinity, potential energy is zero.Kinetic energy is positive. Kinetic energy is always positive, so the total energy has to be positive. But at zero, it just barely escapes.That means that if E is equal to zero, that means it will go out, and by the time it reaches infinity, it has slowed down to V equal to zero. So that velocity is the escape velocity. So E equal to zero gives escape velocity.And that, of course, is equal to 2 M 2 G M M. Yeah. In this case, M, that is the mass of Earth. Yeah, but the number of kilometers per second for Earth.And this number, if you estimate, is about a hundred times the speed of a car, of an ordinary car. But of course, if you send a rocket from the Earth, you must first have enough thrust to make it escape from the atmosphere. And then you have to have this speed before it can go out of the Earth's attraction.There's an R here, sorry. One of the most important events in the history of mankind is the understanding of planetary orbits by Newton. In China, the ancient philosophers did not have, from today's viewpoint, the correct view about the structure of the universe.The Greeks also had an incorrect view, but their way of thinking about it eventually led to Newton's discovery. First, in the Greek times, the most important person was Ptolemy. He lived in Greece from 90 to 168 AD.The way that he was thinking, and in fact the way all the Greeks were thinking, was that the Earth is at the center of the universe. And furthermore, they had the following feeling. They wanted to construct a universe which is most beautiful.Because they believed God must create a most perfect, most beautiful structure. And what is most beautiful? The circle is most beautiful. So they called it the harmony of circles.They thought that the Earth is at the center of the universe, and the stars, the planets, would all go around in circles. But that's not correct. By observation, they knew that, for example, the motion of Mars is very complicated.So they thought it's not a circle. The next complicated but beautiful thing is a circle on a circle. What is a circle on a circle? If you have a ball here, and a circle, while the center is moving in a big circle, there's a particle which goes around this, so you would get something like this.That's called circle on circle. And they tried to adjust the sizes of these two circles to make it match the motion of the planets. It didn't work.So they make it a circle on a circle on a circle. And since there are many planets, so there are many circles, and at one point, somebody had the complete structure of the planets' motion. There were 80 some circles.And that was the general way of thinking about planetary motion. Now why are planetary motions so very important? Because there's agriculture. When you develop agriculture, you know that agriculture depends on the understanding of the seasons.And understanding of the seasons depends on understanding of the motion of the stars around the Earth as you see them. So that astronomy is an important subject in every civilization. It's an obvious thing.Because if you develop agriculture, then astronomy becomes important. But there are regularities of the motion of the stars, of the planets. But there are also strange motions.So people began to try to puzzle out these strange motions. And therefore, this circle on circle on circle kind of idea. That held back Western astronomy for more than 2,000 years, until Copernicus.He advocated heliocenter theory. You all know that Galileo subscribed to this theory. Galileo believed in this theory and was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Nevertheless, many astronomers began to think about the heliocenter theory. The next important development was Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe was an observer.He made accurate measurements of the position of various planets year after year. And after he died, his data was analyzed by Kepler. So Brahe was an experimental astronomer.Kepler was a theoretical astronomer. It was very interesting how Kepler made his great discoveries. He concentrated on the motion of Mars.And the motion of Mars, according to Copernicus' idea, was mostly a circle. In fact, the orbit of Mars as we know it today is almost a circle. But because Brahe's data was very accurate, so Kepler was able to accurately map the position of Mars and found that it's not a circle.It doesn't fit a circle. It almost fits a circle, but not quite. And then one day he suddenly realized it's not a circle at all.It's an ellipse. This is one of the most important events in the history of mankind. The reason that he could land on the idea of an ellipse is also because the Greeks had studied ellipses in detail.We all know, and I'm sure you have learned, plane geometry, Euclid's geometry in high schools. But the Greeks developed geometry much more than Euclid. After Euclid, they studied what is called a conic section.A conic section is you take a cone, take a circular cone, and you can cut it. If you cut it this way, obviously it's a circle. If you cut it this way, it's an ellipse.So this way you get a circle. This way you get an ellipse. If you cut it this way, then it has two branches.One cut in the top, one cut in the bottom. You get a hyperbola. Circle is a circle.

Ellipse is a cone. Hyperbola is called a conic section. All of these curves, their relationship to each other, and their relationship to the cone, were studied in great detail.Beautiful work in Greek times after Euclid. And Kepler, being a theorist, knew these conic section results very well. That is perhaps the reason why it dawned on him one day that the reason that one cannot fit a circular orbit to the trajectory of Mars was because it's not a circle, it is an ellipse.And once that's done, he formulated the three laws. These laws, in today's language, are called empirical laws. Empirical means experimental.The first law is that planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. An ellipse always has two focuses. An ellipse has something called ellipticity.I think ellipticity is called ellipticity, right? Ellipticity. When this ellipticity is zero, it is a circle. When it is one, it is a parabola.When it is greater than one, it is a hyperbola. We'll come to this later. So the first law says that all planetary orbits are ellipses.And that was very accurately correct for a long time. Then, of course, when people had more accurate measurements, they found slight corrections to this. And that correction needed additional considerations.And that's outside of our discussion this semester. The second law says that a planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. This is what it means.When a planet is moving, for example, in one unit time, it has a small triangle. In another unit time, these triangles are in the same area. As it goes around.A planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. The way that he formulated this law shows that he was a very geometrical person. He evidently plotted the curves and observed that when the planet moves slower, that when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower.But this distance is longer, and this area becomes the same. So, when it comes to here, it moves very fast. But in the unit time, it still sweeps the same area.The third law says the period, cube, divided by... T is the period around the sun. A is the semi-major axis. From this point to this point, that distance is called 2A.Different satellites all around the same sun share the same value of T cubed divided by... T squared divided by A cubed. Sorry, T squared. Kepler died in the year 1630.A few years later, Newton was born. Newton explained. Newton was both an experimentalist and a theorist.He was a great experimentalist as well as a theorist. But perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind was his discovery of calculus, of the origin of the planetary motion,

The most important contribution of Newton was he explained the three laws, Kepler's three laws, through the theory of gravitation. These three laws are explained in the book, but it was too simple because it did not succeed in proving the three laws. We are now going to go through the proofs of all three laws.

So first, proof of second law. The second law is the easiest to prove. We had the following theorem.

Several weeks ago we had proven this theorem by straightforward differentiation. If this is the sun, and this is the earth, and this angle is theta, this distance is r. That's called polar coordinates. Using polar coordinates, we found that acceleration has two components.

One is along the direction of r, the other is along the direction of theta. This is the direction of r, and the direction of theta is perpendicular to it. So let us apply Newton's law.

Newton's law says that the force is equal to m a. You multiply this by m, should be equal to force. But the force is only in the r direction, so therefore the theta direction has to be equal to zero. In other words, Newton's law says two r dot theta dot plus r theta double dot is equal to zero.

There's another. We also know that this acceleration, m times that, m times r double dot minus r theta dot squared, has to be equal to minus g m m over r squared. That's the meaning of f equal to m a. Okay, let's take out the first one.

That one means d dt of r squared theta dot. That's equal to two r r dot theta dot plus r squared theta double dot. Just by straight computation.

And that has to be equal to zero, because let's call this one, this two. Therefore, r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. r squared theta dot is equal to r times r theta dot is equal to a constant.

Now, this is r. This angle is r theta dot. r theta dot dt is this angle. Therefore, one half, but one half of r times r theta dot dt is equal to area swept.

Area swept in dt. This is equal to one half of r squared theta dot dt is equal to one half c dt. In other words, area swept in dt is a constant in dt, and that's second law, i.e. this area swept is proportional to dt.

It's a constant in dt. But r times r theta dot is also the angular momentum explanation. r times r theta dot is a constant.

It's equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. In other words, the second law of Kepler is nothing but the conservation of angular momentum. As long as the force is always along the direction of r, there is conservation of angular momentum, and then there is Kepler's second law.In other words, suppose the force is not one over r squared, it's one over r cubed, or anything, which depends only on r, but with no theta component, then second law always is correct, i.e. second law follows from angular momentum conservation plus central force. Central force means that the force is always directed to the center. In other words, no theta component.Next, we are going to prove the first law, but before we do that, let me box this equation. r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. Now we go to equation 2. Equation 2 becomes r double dot minus r theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.In fact, let's put m back in. I multiply both sides by r and integrate. I get m over r squared plus r squared theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.If I differentiate this, this becomes this, multiplied by r dot, and this becomes this. Let's forget about this. It's simpler that we directly use the energy law.

We know the energy. We have proven 20 minutes ago that the total energy is a kinetic energy, one half mv squared plus u, which is mmg over r. That is equal to a constant. This actually follows from this.

Only you integrate this, you multiply this by r dot and integrate, you get this expression. But since we have already the general statement, so we might as well start from here. This is the kinetic energy.

This is the potential energy. And that results equal to constant. We call it E. And again, we divide the case into E equal to zero, E greater than zero, or E less than zero.For a particle which can go to infinity, which can barely go to infinity, E is equal to zero. If E is greater than zero, that means that when r is infinity, this part is positive. So it can go to infinity with a finite velocity.If it is negative, this part cannot become zero, because if this part is zero, this is positive. If E is negative, that never happens. In other words, case one, E less than zero cannot escape.This is the case that we'll deal with first. Later on, we'll deal with E equal to zero and E greater than zero. So let us write E is equal to one-half of m. V squared is r dot squared plus r squared theta dot squared minus mg over r. r dot is equal to dr, dc, the dc, the dt.So I can write it this way. And therefore, this is equal to one-half of m dr d theta squared plus r squared times theta dot squared. But to see the dots, woman, but we have r squared theta dot equal to a constant.We have that formula before, according to the second law. So I can use that to eliminate theta dot. So this becomes c squared over r fourth.Let us now multiply this whole by r fourth. So we get E r fourth is equal to m over two. E is negative.So you will write minus a squared to be equal to 2E over mc squared. Note that E is negative, so I write minus a squared. B is equal to 2mg over c squared.I saw this equation many years ago, of course. So yesterday, I tried to solve this equation. The more I solved it, the more complicated it became.Later, after thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a trick. This trick is like this. You have to change a variable.If you want to use this r, you can take this r to the other side. Then open a square. Then you get dr d theta.And then you divide after you get theta. It's an integral over dr of a complicated expression. You can do it that way, too, but that's not an easy way.Then I remembered there was a trick. I don't know who first found the trick. Newton must have found the equivalent trick, but he did not write it in his book.The trick is to invert r. Put r equal to 1 over rho. Then dr d rho, dr d theta, becomes dr d rho, d rho d theta. But dr d rho is equal to 1 over rho squared.So we put that in there. You get 1 over rho fourth, d rho d theta squared, plus 1 over rho squared, is equal to minus a squared over rho fourth, plus b over rho cubed. You multiply by rho fourth.You get d rho d theta squared is equal to minus a squared, plus b rho, minus rho squared. The advantage of this compared with this, it's very similar. But here dr d theta has r squared term, r cubed term, r fourth term.In rho, it has become constant rho and rho squared. So this is simpler than this. And that's the trick.When you have something like this, the natural thing is to perfect the square. So this is a minus rho, minus b over 2 squared, plus b squared over 4. That takes care of these two terms, minus a squared. So let's call this sigma squared.So we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2, r by 1 over rho. Then this becomes b sigma d theta squared, is equal to minus sigma squared, plus k squared. Where we define k squared to be b squared over four minus a squared.How do I know it's a positive number and not a negative number? It can't be negative because the left side is positive. So unless this is positive, the equation doesn't make sense. When you have an equation like this, by inspection you know what to do.You should write sigma as k sine theta, sine phi. When you do that, d sigma d theta becomes k cosine phi d phi d theta squared. Is equal to k square minus k square sine square theta.A sine square phi, which is equal to k squared cosine square phi. The reason that we do this is because the k square cosine square phi cancels. So we get d phi d theta equal to 1. So d phi d theta is equal to plus minus 1. We need only a constant of d phi d theta equal to 1. So therefore, we can write phi is equal to theta plus a constant.So we put that back in. We get rho is equal to 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine of phi theta plus constant. The constant doesn't matter.All it means is you change the origin of theta. So I can make that constant equal to 0. So I would get 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine theta. I can write this as b over 2 times 1 plus e, where e is equal to k, 2k over b. It's 2 over b times k. k is square root of b squared over 4 minus a squared.So therefore, it's equal to square root of 1 minus 4a squared over b squared. And that is equal to square root of 1 minus 2c squared over m squared g squared times minus e over m. This is a very important quantity. It's called the eccentricity.It tells you how ellipse, how much it deviates from a circle. Let's look at the expression. It's the square root of 1 minus c. c is related to the angular momentum, how much it sweeps per unit time.m squared g squared are related to the mass of the sun and the gravitational constant. Minus e over m. e is the energy of the planet. That e is clearly proportional to m. In other words, if the Earth were twice as massive, you can think of it as two Earths stuck together.And each of them would still follow the same orbit. So therefore, e is always proportional to m. So e over m is the per unit mass energy for the planet. And we get this.And this is... We shall now show that it is an ellipse. It is an ellipse because this is another trick. When you have an equation which has r in it, you always follow what we are going to demonstrate as a trick.I take this formula and multiply both by r. So I get 1 is equal to b over 2 times r plus e times r sine theta. r sine theta is y. You have an equation which both has x, y, z in it and has r in it. The way to do it is to move everything to one side which does not contain r.

And then square it. In other words, you get 1 over B over 2EY is equal to B over 2R. Now I square both sides.

So I get 1 minus BEY plus B squared E squared Y squared over 4 is equal to B squared 4R squared, which is X squared Y squared. This way we get rid of the R. R has a square root and is not convenient. Now if you look at this, it is an ellipse.This E is less than 1. How do I know it's an ellipse? Because you know when you have a quadratic equation in X and Y, we'll show that this is an ellipse in a minute. Let us multiply this by 4 over B squared. Multiply it by 4 over B squared.I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B plus E squared Y squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared Y squared. I shall define this.Oh, sorry. I get 4B squared is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared times Y squared plus 4E divided by 1 minus E squared. 2E.

1 minus E squared Y squared plus. This is 2. 2EY. This is 2E.

2EY over B minus minus 4E squared over B squared or minus E squared. What I am doing here is to divide this into squares. I move this over here and divide it into squares.I shall now define an alpha. Let me see if I am doing this right or wrong. I shall now define an alpha.Square is equal to 4 over B squared. I shall now define an alpha. I shall now define an alpha.1 minus E squared. This is equal to alpha squared over 1 minus E squared. Where Y prime is equal to Y plus 2E.So you can see that this function is an X squared. 1 minus E squared is positive. So this is a typical ellipse.If you want to write it as a standard ellipse, you have to write it like this. You have to divide this whole thing by 2. This has now become a standard ellipse. I think you all recognize it.This number is bigger than this number. Because this is divided by 1 minus E squared. So its major axis is called A. Semi-major axis.So this ellipse is like this. Let me see if I am doing this right. Yes.Its semi-major axis is this A. It is equal to the square root of this thing. It is equal to alpha over 1 minus E squared. This is called A. Minor axis is called B. It is this distance.What is this equal to? It is equal to the square root of this. It is equal to alpha. It is QED.We have now proven that the orbit is an ellipse. Before the ellipse shifted, Y' then Y. Before the ellipse shifted, this is a center. This is a focus.We are not going to prove this. You can try it. It has a standard formula.You know the major axis and the minor axis. You know where the focus is. You will find that the focus is the shift from Y to Y' just now.Okay. Now we have the third law. Proof of the third law.The third law tells you that its period has something to do with its semi-major axis. We use its area. Area of ellipse.You know that the area of a circle is πr². If an ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis, a and b, its area is πab. If a is equal to b, it becomes πa².So we know that just now we have a major axis and a minor axis. So it is definitely α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Now, one half of r²θ' is equal to ddt of area swept.We have this formula before. Because this is r, this is rθ'dt. So one half of that is equal to area swept.One half of that is area swept per unit time. So if r²θ' is equal to 2c, then it is c over 2. Because r²θ' is equal to c. Therefore, the total area of the ellipse divided by the period is equal to this. Since this is per unit area, the total area divided by t is this.So we know that the total area is equal to tc over 2. But this is equal to α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. So we have this formula. We have calculated the period.The period is equal to 2 over c. The total area is equal to this π. πα² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Then we know that a is equal to α over 1 minus e². This is the formula we just had.So we can calculate t² over a³. After calculating this algebra for a long time, we can prove that this is equal to 4π² over mg. This is in the book.But the book doesn't prove this. Because the book doesn't talk about ellipse. It only talks about the circle case.Now we are proving that this is general. And this is of course the Kepler's third law. So t² over a³ is a constant which depends on the sun's mass.Different planets have the same constant. So we have proven all three all three Kepler's laws. Next time, we are going to discuss the other two cases.Namely, e is equal to 0 and e is greater than 0. I'll be in my class in my office this afternoon between 4 and 5. Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this. So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun...

Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1. The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery. Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established. 所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things? The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho. So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine. It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one.

And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week.

I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared.

So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared. And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious. Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive.

Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure. Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject. The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute. The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years.

began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity.

Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity. And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity.

He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy.

So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed.

That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found.

So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004.

There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery.

I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property.

And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery.

Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia.

We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid.

The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order.

Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order.

So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term.

It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order.

But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things.

I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order.

All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class.

I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here.

There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom.

The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface.

The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation.

So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top.

Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere.

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance.

You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil.

So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1.

But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2.

Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever. A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath.

If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area.

And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight.

But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance.

So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy.

But what you can magnify is the force. Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this.

I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng.

So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent.

So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this.

If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow.

This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem.

He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work.

Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube. So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow,

Incompressible flow, incompressible is not compressible. In other words, the density cannot be changed. For example, air is a compressible flow.Because if you add pressure to the air, it becomes denser. But water is essentially incompressible. If you add a lot of pressure, the density of the water will have a small change.So, mostly talking about the water, it's an incompressible flow. Now let's talk about the incompressible flow. If this is A, and this velocity is v, and this velocity is v'.Now, very clearly, A times v times delta t, in a time delta t, you would have a distance of v delta t times an area. So you get that this is the total volume of liquid that enters this area. And that must be equal to the amount which goes out, because you cannot compress it.So therefore, this is equal to A prime v prime delta t. So A v is equal to A prime v prime. In other words, the velocity is inversely proportional to the area. That's, of course, obvious.If you have a river, which is very narrow, and suddenly becomes very wide, then the fast flow in the narrow part, upon coming to the wide part, would slow down. Obviously. Bernoulli was a very distinguished family.That family produced a number of important mathematicians and scientists. There is a chapter about the Bernoulli family in the book that I had recommended to you called The Name of Mathematics. And Bernoulli's equation is something like this.Suppose you have this is the y-axis. This is a vertical upwards. Suppose you have a tube which goes this way.Let us consider a flow which goes this way. And we already know that the area here is smaller, the area here is larger, so therefore the velocity here is larger than the velocity here. So let us say after a delta t, this thing goes to here.So it goes from the solid line to the dotted line. Now we want to consider energy conservation. Again, these are not necessarily... we are not thinking of it as a tube.These are the lines of flow. So the whole thing may be in a very big vessel, but there is a laminar flow, so they are flowing smoothly. So at this point, there is an area.There is A1, and here is A2. At this point, there is pressure 1, there is pressure 2. At this point, there is V1, there is V2. Now we know A1V1 is equal to A2V2.We already had that. What does energy conservation say? Energy conservation says that the work done on the water in this region is equal to the energy increase. Right? That is what is meant by energy conservation.We are assuming there is no turbulence, so there is energy conservation. But what is the work done on this? This is equal to... In this side, we do work on it, and the force is equal to P1A1. That is the force.The distance traveled is equal to V1 delta t. Right? This is the force done on the system. But at this point, the system does work on the outside, so therefore you have to subtract P2A2. P2A2 is the force times the distance traveled.It's V2 delta t. So this difference is the total work done on the system. Now what is this one? What is the energy increase? The energy increase is the energy in the middle is not changed. Before delta t and after delta t, it's the same.The material may have changed, but it's the same amount of mass moving with the same velocity at every point, so there is no change. The only change is that in this area and in this area, or in this volume and in this volume. So what is the change? The change is the total.What is the total mass of it? It's A1 V1 delta t. That is the volume times rho. That's the total mass. The total mass times one half V1 squared minus V2 squared.V2 squared minus V1 squared. That's the kinetic energy change. Does everybody agree? This part is the mass.One half m V squared is the kinetic energy. So this part is the kinetic energy here, and this part is the kinetic energy here, and so it's the kinetic energy increase is that, plus the potential energy increase. The potential energy increase is the same thing.It's the same mass plus it's rho gh, or it's mgh. So g times y2 minus y1. In the bracket, here's the kinetic energy increase.Here's the potential energy increase. So let's write it out. We have now delta V. Let's write V. The volume is equal to A1 V1 delta t, and it's equal to A2 V2 delta t. So if I rewrite this equation, I get P1 times V1 times this capital V, times V1 times capital V. No, no, no.P1 capital V minus P2 capital V is the left side. It's equal to rho V times one-half V2 squared minus V1 squared plus gy2 minus gy1. So if you cancel the V, you get P1 minus P2 is equal to rho one-half rho V2 squared minus V1 squared plus rho gy2 minus y1.Or you get P1 plus one-half rho V1 squared plus rho gy1 is equal to P2 plus one-half rho V2 squared plus rho gy2. That's called Bernoulli's equation. That's 15-20.This is a very useful formula. For example, let's take, if you have a tank of water and you have a little hole near the bottom, then everybody would know that the water would flow out. This is a simple problem, 15-9.So let us apply, we assume that this is smooth flowing. If it is too large a height, it could become turbulent. But let us have not too large a height.So suppose this drop of height is H. So we take this point to be one, take this point to be two. At one, there's the atmospheric pressure plus the original velocity of one-half rho V1 squared. But if this is a very small hole, the surface drops down very slowly.So we neglect this. Plus rho gh is equal to, the pressure at this point is rho zero, is P zero. Again, atmospheric pressure plus one-half rho V2 squared plus zero.So since P zero cancels P zero, we get the rho gh is equal to one-half rho V2 squared, which essentially says that the velocity is equivalent to if the thing has to drop down from here to here. But that's not strange because by energy conservation, because we obtained this formula through the Bernoulli's equation. The Bernoulli's equation is based on energy conservation.And so therefore, of course we get energy conservation. I advise you to read Chapter 15 very carefully. There are a lot of little discussions.It's... I think you'll gain general information by reading the book. But as far as the physics principles are concerned, we have, in the last 40 minutes, have gone through the important points completely. So we now go to the next chapter, Chapter 16, Oscillations.Everybody knows that if you have oscillation, there's a frequency. There's a unit which is called a hertz. One hertz is equal to one cycle per second.And if you have a clock, the pendulum usually has a frequency of one hertz, one cycle per second. When you talk about cycle, it is the return to the original point. If you have a swing, usually the frequency is, let's say, one third of a hertz.But for radio waves, it has a very high frequency. If you go to light waves, light has been known, of course, by mankind since the beginning of history. But it was only after Maxwell that it was recognized that ordinary light, visible light, is an electromagnetic vibration.And that has a very, very high frequency, much higher than, say, radio waves' frequency. And later on, people found the gamma rays. Gamma rays have even higher frequencies.Now, if you look at the figure 34-1 of the book, it has a spectrum of various vibrations. These different vibrations go from very slow ones to very, very high frequencies. The highest frequencies are gamma rays, or hard gamma rays, or cosmic rays.Cosmic rays, some of them have enormously high frequencies. So, oscillation is a very fundamental phenomenon. It's very, very common.Now, in the book, it writes a typical one-dimensional oscillation. The displacement, x, as a function of t, is written as x0 times cosine omega t plus phi. This x0 is called amplitude, 中文叫振幅.This omega is called angular frequency. Sorry, angular velocity. This phi is called phase angle, or phase constant, or phase constant.And this, what's under the cosine, the whole thing is called the phase. The phase would usually go from 0 to 360 degrees, to 720 degrees, and so on and so forth. That the phase is the most important thing was well known once people began to study, for example, water waves.But we now know in the 20th century that the concept of phase is deeply related. The concept of phase is related to the mathematical structure of the fundamental forces of nature. There are many fundamental forces of nature.I'm sure you know the gravity force is a fundamental force of nature. Electric and magnetic force is another type of fundamental forces of nature. Then in the 20th century, we know that there are additional forces.There are the so-called strong forces, which determine the structure of nuclei. There are the weak forces, which determine, for example, radioactivity. So in the 20th century, we now know that there are four types of forces.It turns out that all these forces are related to the concept of phase. And in fact, the prevailing theory now is called the gauge theory. The structure of all these four fundamental forces of nature are all gauge theories.But gauge theory is a wrong name. There is a word in English called misnomer. Nomer means naming.Mis is wrong. Misnomer means a wrong naming. It shouldn't have been called gauge theory.It should have been called phase theory. Because its basic concept is based on the concept of phase. At the beginning of this year, I gave a talk in Germany, in Ulm.Ulm is the small town where Einstein was born 125 years ago. They had a celebration for the 125th birthday of Einstein. And I gave a talk there.In which I talked about the fundamental contributions of Einstein. And in that talk, I mentioned that what Einstein wanted to do was to understand the structures of all forces. And he wanted to have a unified understanding.It's called a unified theory. He did not succeed in his lifetime. We have not succeeded yet.But we know that one of the key ingredients of the future unified field theory is gauge theory, or in fact, phase theory. So that shows that the concept of phase is of fundamental importance in physics. Now, the equation that gives rise to the phase is, of course, this simple equation.This equation we have written down several times. And we have applied it to a pendulum. We have applied it to a mass attached to a spring.But in those discussions, we did not discuss dissipation. In those examples that we discussed, either a simple swing or a compressed spring, there was energy conservation. But in actual practice, all motion encounters frictions.And in particular, you can do an experiment. And the diagram of the experiment is given in the book. Suppose you have a spring here.You attach a mass to it. But you now produce some larger friction than given by air. So, for example, you have a range like this.You attach an object to the mass. And then immerse that object in some liquid. So when the mass moves up and down, this object moves in the liquid and creates a friction.So this way you can study the dissipation. And it turns out that the dissipation follows an equation such that m x double dot is equal to minus k x minus b x dot minus b x dot. x dot is, of course, the velocity.It gives you a force which is proportional to the velocity. So this is the typical harmonic motion with dissipation. And it's usually written in this form.Harmonic motion with dissipation. Why do we call it dissipation? Let us try to look at the energy balance of this equation. We have looked at harmonic motion before.And we have written the conservation energy equation. How did we obtain that? We take this force equation and multiply it by x dot, by velocity. So we now do the same.We get m x double dot x dot is equal to minus k x x dot minus b x dot squared. But this is equal to d dt of one half m x dot squared. It's equal to minus d dt of one half k x squared minus b x dot squared.Or, it's d dt of the kinetic energy, that's this term, plus potential energy, that's this term, is equal to minus b x squared. So, that's it.

Total energy, that's the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies, the total energy changes with time, and it's always negative, minus Bx dot squared. And that's why this is called dissipation. It's Bv squared.It's proportional to the velocity squared. That also shows that B has to be positive, because dissipation always decreases the total energy, decreases the total mechanical energy. Actually, later on we learn that if you include the heat energy, then what is lost in the mechanical energy goes into heat.So once you understand that, you eventually find out that if you add the heat energy, then the total energy is not changed. What happens is that you are changing the mechanical energy into heat energy. And after that is understood, people ask, can I change heat energy back into mechanical energy? Answer, no.

And that is the second law of thermodynamics. We'll come to that. So the simple statement of the second law of thermodynamics is that you can change mechanical energy by various means, by friction, into heat energy.But you cannot let change heat energy into mechanical energy. Okay, now we want to deal with the mathematics of this boxed equation, the harmonic motion with dissipation. This equation is a second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation.Second-order because you have a second derivative. Linear because everything is either x or x dot or x. It's only the first power. Homogeneous in the sense that every term is the same order.If you have something on the right-hand side which is not proportional to x, then it's not homogeneous. So this is called homogeneous linear differential equation of second-order. For such homogeneous differential equations, there is a trick.The trick depends on the fact that the exponential function, let's take exponential i alpha t. If I differentiate the exponential function, I get the same exponential function multiplied by constant. So if you repeatedly differentiate it, you do not get new functions. You only get the same function multiplied by different constants.And that is the way to solve such equation. So we try. We try a solution.We try x is equal to x zero times exponential i alpha t. How do I know I should try this? I just said that because when I differentiate, I get back the same. If I start with, let's say, x to the fifth power, if I differentiate it, it becomes x to the fourth power, and that's not the same as the original one. So that's very bad for trying to solve this equation.But the exponential has the property that it doesn't change form. It only becomes multiplied by something. So if I substitute that into this equation, into the original equation, I get m x zero times exponential i alpha t. The second derivative becomes i alpha squared.Each time I differentiate, I get the i alpha down. And the next one is b. I differentiate once, so I get the one i alpha. The last one is k. So do you agree that this is the equation? So that means I get, this is not zero, so this has to be equal to zero.So I get minus alpha squared plus i b alpha plus k is equal to zero. No more x. So that determines alpha. So this is a quadratic equation, so we get alpha is equal to, sorry, m. This is wrong.Minus m. So it's equal to 2m i b plus minus square root of minus b squared, or i b squared plus 4mk. Let's write that as b over 2m i plus minus omega zero, where omega zero is equal to square root of 4mk minus b squared divided by 2m. Did I make a mistake? Correct.So I can take either the plus sign or the minus sign. So let's first take the plus sign. If I take the plus sign, I get x is equal to x zero times exponential i, exponential i t times b over 2m i plus omega zero.And that, according to what we just did, is a complex solution, but it is a solution. However, if I take the minus sign, I would get this. But this is equal to x zero times exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential i t omega zero.This one is equal to x zero exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential minus i t omega zero. So I get two solutions. Both of them have a real damping term.This is called damping, damping term. It's an exponentially decreasing function of time. If the coefficient in front of t is small, if b is almost zero, in other words, if it's a very frictionless, almost frictionless motion, then this exponential exponent is very small, and it takes a long time for it to damp down.T has to be very large for that exponential function to die down. So that's called slow damping. But then we have these two exponentials, and these are complex.Now, we have two different solutions. Since the original equation is linear, I can take any coefficient of the first solution, add it to any coefficient of the second solution, I still get a solution, because the original equation was linear. So once you understand that you know what is the real solution, you just take the two of them.For example, if you add them with the same coefficient, you get a cosine. If you subtract them and multiply it by i, you get a sine function. So therefore, what do you get in general? So in general, these are special solutions.The general solution is a linear combination of the two, and so the general solution, general real solution, is x equal to some x0 times this damping factor, minus b t over 2m, times cosine of omega 0 t plus phi. Does everybody understand this last step? Why the sum of these two becomes this? It's trivial, but you have to go through that argument. So think of it.You have to be totally familiar with why those two special solutions, when you multiply by proper coefficients and add, comes to this form. This form, this cosine of two things can be expanded into a cosine term plus a sine term, and each of them can be written as the linear combination of these two, and vice versa. Any real linear combination of those two has to be of this form.Now, if I plot this curve, first I can plot this explanation function. This explanation function goes like this. And when this cosine becomes one, it touches this curve.When cosine becomes minus one, it touches the reflected curve. So the x oscillates between these two. So therefore, you get when t is equal to zero, this term is one, so you get some phase.So you get something like this. I did very well. It looks pretty good.All oscillations follow this. If you have a very small damping, then you can go on and on and on. The book has a diagram with a much smaller damping than what I have.How do you count the damping? You count the number of oscillations before it goes down by a factor of two. And this one damps down maybe after six cycles. In the book, I think that one has maybe damps down by a factor of two only after maybe 20 cycles.But now one can make oscillations with very, very small damping, such that you can go to billions of oscillations without any real change of the amplitude. What we have done in the previous section is to look at the damped simple harmonic oscillator. That is when we come to electricity, to alternating currents, that becomes an extremely important subject.In fact, the whole electric engineering department used to study only such type of equations. However, an even more important one is that the motion is periodically subject to an external force. So that's called forced oscillation.Forced oscillation has an equation like this. But it has something on the... Every term in here is a force, of course, because mx double dot is a force. Suppose there's a force which is, let's say, cosine omega t plus, let's say, phi one.This omega is the external frequency. We had omega zero. Omega zero is the natural frequency.Omega may...this external frequency may or may not be equal to omega zero. So that's called forced oscillation. So we now want to find a solution of this equation.We try...it's clear that learning from what we had done before, we should again use complex variables and only worry about how to add the solutions, add complex solutions to eventually make it real. Why do we do that? Because the exponential function, exponential i alpha t, has the nice property that every time we differentiate, you do not change the form of the equation. So should we try exponential i alpha t? No, because if we try exponential i alpha t, the x double dot is exponential i alpha t, x dot is exponential i alpha t, x is exponential i alpha t, but on the right-hand side, it's exponential i omega t, and that doesn't work.You get an equation which the left side and the right side do not match. So what should we try? Obviously, we should try exponential i omega t, because then every term is i omega t. So we are going to try x equal to x zero exponential i omega t. So we put that in there. Then we get x zero exponential i omega t times m times double dot.I get i omega squared plus b x dot, so I get i omega plus k. That's the left side. And the right side, the original, I told you that we are going to worry about the complexity afterwards. So we now just write f exponential i omega t. So that's a brilliant idea, because both sides have exponential i omega t. So therefore, so we get x zero times minus m omega squared plus b i omega plus k is equal to f. No more x. So x zero is equal to f divided by minus f divided by m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. X zero is the amplitude of the oscillation, and the denominator is a complex number.To understand how this complex number looks like, let's call it defined to be m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. Let us now go back to the k. Now we had the equation before, namely k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. Previously we had the equation for k. k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. So I substitute that in there.I get m omega squared minus b i omega plus. So something's wrong. Just a minute.I did I get a sign wrong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Minus m alpha squared plus b i alpha.So that is equal to m omega squared minus alpha squared plus b i or minus b i omega minus alpha. So that is equal to omega minus alpha times m omega plus alpha minus i b. But alpha, by definition, is equal to b over 2m, is the damping factor, plus omega zero. So I substitute that in there.I get the omega minus omega zero minus. There's an i here. Minus b over 2m i times m omega plus m omega zero minus b over 2i plus b over 2 minus i b. Right.Which is equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m i times m omega plus omega zero minus i b over 2. Let us look at this expression. This expression is the product of two numbers. A complex number and another complex number.Take the case of small damping, i.e., omega is much bigger, b over 2m. If omega is very small and is very large compared to b over 2m, that means the damping, you oscillate. If omega is large and the damping is small, that means you oscillate many, many times before it damps.So let's take that case. If that is the case, you see that this term is small. And that means, we'll come back to that.Here, omega and omega zero, so omega and omega zero are both large. We consider omega to be near omega zero. Omega is large.Omega zero is also large. But the difference between omega and omega zero to be small. That difference may be of the same order as this damping term.And here, you see, this is a large number. This is a small number. So d, in that case, is equivalent to, is approximately equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m I. This is a small number.This is a small number. And this, this I b, is essentially 2m omega zero. Because this is small and omega is so equal to, approximately equal to omega zero.So you see that, what is this d? If I take the absolute value of d squared, it's equal to omega minus omega zero squared plus b squared over 4m squared. If I now take the square root of this and put it in the denominator, the x zero absolute value is equal to f absolute value divided by d absolute value. And that's equal to f absolute value divided by this number.So if I plot omega here and let this point be omega equal to omega zero, then this expression

One over this expression, the amplitude is like this. When omega is equal to omega zero, the denominator is the smallest. So the amplitude is the largest.And the width here is proportional to this. So this curve is given in the book. It's called the resonance curve.So let me put it in words. We have an oscillator which naturally oscillates with a frequency, and that frequency is called omega zero. I now apply an external frequency on it, which may or may not be the same as omega zero.Then when the external frequency is very different from the natural frequency, the amplitude is small. But when the external frequency is like the natural frequency, then the amplitude becomes very large. Now this phenomenon we all know.If you have a child on a swing, if you periodically give the child a push, if you push with the same frequency as the natural frequency of the swing, then the swing would go higher and higher. But if you just take a very different frequency, then you will not be able to make the swing go higher and higher. And when you build a bridge, for example, the bridge has a natural frequency.In fact, there are several natural frequencies. We'll come to that. Because what we have been doing is a one-dimensional problem.In general, you have a multi-dimensional problem. Then there are several ways of vibrating, and they have different frequencies. So it can have more than one natural frequency.If now you apply a force on it, and that force resonates with one of those frequencies, then that mode of vibration will be amplified. And in fact, there was a famous case of a bridge in the United States near Seattle. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.I think it was something like in the 1930s. The engineers did not calculate it correctly. And when the wind reaches a certain speed, it has a driving force with a certain frequency.And it happens that that frequency matched one of the natural frequencies of that bridge. And then it vibrates bigger and bigger. And I think something like a few hours before the disaster was going to happen, they realized, the city realized, that something very important is going to happen.So they made a movie of it. They took a real movie. And then you can see that one particular vibration becomes amplified.Eventually, the whole bridge collapsed. But in that case, there was a record. There's a visual record of that particular collapse.That is a very famous movie. You may be able to get it from the Internet. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.So the engineers in constructing anything had to estimate for every mode of vibration the natural frequency. And then try to do it in such a manner that any external force, the vibration, the frequency, would not be close to any of the natural frequencies to avoid the disasters. At this point, we have a complex solution.But we can have two different complex solutions, and then you can combine them to make a real solution. So I will not go through that in detail. But you try to puzzle that out.But I want to change it into a slightly different subject. And that is what happens if you have many degrees of freedom. What we had talked about is a one-dimensional problem.First, let's talk about the harmonic motion. Harmonic motion for small amplitudes. For discussing this, we go back to the equation of motion.But instead of talking about the equation of motion, we talk about the energy, total energy. Total energy is equal to kinetic energy plus potential energy. If you have several degrees of freedom, for example, you have a body like a molecule.It has several degrees of freedom. So the kinetic energy, typically, is like a summation of one-half m i x i dot squared. Where x i, for example, you have a molecule.Each molecule has a fixed position when it's not vibrating. x i is now the deviation from equilibrium position. For example, a water molecule consists of one oxygen and two hydrogens.Because of the full structure, it has a certain angle. So this is the position at rest. But when it starts to vibrate, each of them moves.So this one, so you have three x i's, which are the deviations of the oxygen from its rest position. And you have three for this, three for this. So you would have altogether, to start with, nine x's.So you have x1 up to x9. Each of them is the deviation of that particular molecule from the original at rest position. So the kinetic energy is like that.The potential energy, you expand into a power series of that x. So it's equal to a constant plus a linear term and a quadratic term. A linear term meaning it's a proponent of x. A quadratic term is a proponent of x squared plus a cubic term. The constant doesn't matter.All energies, because you usually take the derivative of the energy, so therefore that constant drops out. The linear term has to be zero, because if all the x's are equal to zero, it's like the bottom of the potential. So this term is equal to zero, because x i equal to zero is the static situation.Does everybody understand what I'm talking about? Let's take a one-dimensional problem. We have a u. u is the potential energy. And we have a curve like this.And we are now talking about a equilibrium point. At the equilibrium point, the potential energy is a quadratic expression, no linear term. If it's at this point, there's a linear term.But that's not a point of equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium, the linear term always vanishes. So that's what I'm talking about, because that's why this is zero.So therefore, we only have a quadratic term. And these cubic terms for small vibrations are very small, so we also drop them. So the potential energy becomes essentially just a quadratic expression.In other words, the potential energy is equal to summation a i j x i x j. That's a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression like this can be written as a matrix. It's x times the a times x. So let me summarize what I said.For a vibration of a molecule, in fact, it can be of a crystal, you have many, many coordinates. And the kinetic energy is the sum of x i dot squared with some coefficients proportional to the masses. The potential energy is essentially a quadratic expression, which can be written in this form.So the potential energy is determined by a square matrix. That square matrix can be made symmetrical, because x1, x2, and x2, x1, you can combine into one term and divide by two. So therefore, A is real symmetrical.A real symmetrical matrix by a linear transformation can become diagonal. We have used that theorem. So that means if I change from the x, which is a series of x's, into x prime, so I write x as gamma times x prime.I transform x into x prime. Then in terms of x prime, it becomes diagonal. In other words, the potential energy in x prime becomes omega 1 x1 squared plus omega 2 squared x2 squared, no cross term.And these omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 are the natural frequencies. So let me summarize what I just said. It's a fundamental idea.It's actually extremely simple. When you are near equilibrium, if you neglect the triple cubic terms and high order terms, then the potential energy is quadratic. Any quadratic form can be diagonalized, and the diagonal coefficients are the natural frequencies.So when you have the Tacoma Bridge, the Tacoma Bridge has several motions. It can do this, it can do this, it can twist. So the engineers have certain approximations of a certain number of frequencies.I don't know how many. And they can calculate that matrix and can diagonalize it. So by computation, they can know the natural frequency.And the trick is to make that bridge such that the prevailing wind in that area would not generate a force frequency which is near any of those natural frequencies. What I just said in the last ten minutes is a general principle. We know that all motions, when they are small, are likely to become almost likely to become damped simple harmonic motions.And with damped simple harmonic motions, there are two fundamental quantities. One is the damping term, the magnitude of the damping term. The other is the frequency.And that, in fact, applies to all motions. Okay, thank you. Thank you.What we just discussed last time near the end, from what some students asked me, I realized I did not make something so clear. So today I want to make a few points. First, last time we talked about a u. Originally we were talking about a one-dimensional u. Now we are talking about the equilibrium point.Why is it equilibrium? Because the derivative of u is force. Equilibrium means there is no force. So it is at this point.When it's near the bottom, it's a parabola. It's approximately a parabola. What we want to do is to have a many-dimensional problem.So think of this u as a u of x, y, z. So it's a surface. If it's a u of x, y, this is u, this is x, this is y. It's a surface. At the surface there is a point which is a minimum, and we want to discuss what happens near the minimum.So suppose there are three variables, x, y, z. Then we expand u as u zero. That's the u, the potential energy at the point of equilibrium. Then we have the first-order term, alpha x plus beta y plus gamma z. Then we have second-order terms.We have cubic terms. If it is an equilibrium point, the derivative of u with respect to x, the derivative of u with respect to y, the derivative of u with respect to z at x, y, z equal to zero has to be zero. So if I take the derivative of this with respect to x, I get alpha.The derivative of these terms, when you put x, y, z equal to zero, all become zero. So that means that this term, alpha, has to be equal to zero. So this has to be equal.This is called the first-order term. The first-order term must be zero for the point to be an equilibrium point. These are called the second-order terms.These are called third-order terms. The second-order terms and third-order terms for small vibrations are all very small. For example, suppose x, y, z are all of the order of one percent.Then the quadratic term, what are the quadratic terms? There are x squared, y squared, z squared, x, y, x, z, z, x, y, z. There are six quadratic terms. Suppose x, y, z are all of the order of one percent. Then these terms are all of the order of one thousandth.Then these are all of the order of one millionth. So for small vibrations, these can all be neglected. So these are what we call concentrates.These are of the order of one thousandth, these are of the order of one millionth. These are of the order of one thousandth, these are of the order of one millionth. You can forget about the order of one thousandth first.So there is only this. If you have not three variables, but n variables, this becomes the summation aij xi xj. So what's the conclusion? The conclusion is that near an equilibrium point for small vibrations, you can neglect high order terms and only include the quadratic terms.The linear terms are zero because we are talking about the equilibrium point. Now once you have a quadratic expression like this, you can write it as this times a times this. A is a square matrix.Then you can diagonalize this by a theorem about matrices. So after the diagonalization, so this becomes, this is x, it becomes x prime times diagonal times x prime. In other words, it becomes equal to a constant, let's say alpha 1 x1 prime squared plus alpha 2 x2 prime squared plus alpha n xn prime squared.Without cross terms, no x1 prime x2 prime. Because this is a diagonal. If you add this to the kinetic energy, it becomes a lot of harmonic oscillators.Because a harmonic oscillator, the typical potential energy is x, a harmonic oscillator of one dimension, its potential energy is x squared. Now these are all separate. So it becomes a lot of harmonic oscillators, each with its own frequency.These are called the principal frequencies. In other words, near equilibrium for small vibrations, the motion is a superposition of many harmonic oscillators, of many harmonic motions, each with a natural frequency. Let me read that.Near equilibrium for small vibrations, the motion is a superposition of many harmonic motions, each with a frequency. This is a very general statement. Next one.I went too fast last time at the end. We were discussing a forced oscillation. So it's mx double dot plus bx dot plus kx, is equal to f cosine omega t. By the way, it's not omega t, it's omega t plus phi.Then I write it as omega of t plus phi over omega. I call this t prime, then it becomes omega t prime. So if you want to change it to t prime, then there is no phi.In other words, you can always consider just to shift the time coordinate, take a different point as the origin, and use that as the new time, then the differential equation does not have the phi. So we can always consider this equation. This equation, let's call it A. Then I wrote another equation like this.This equation is B. I did not make clear why I can go from A to B. Now I want to make that clear. Suppose you solve this equation. After you solve it, you take the real part of your solution x. Then you take the real part of this equation.The left side looks like this. The right side becomes this. So any real solution, no, any complex solution of B has a real part which satisfies.Therefore, this is a very common trick. Instead of dealing with this type of equation A, you deal always with the type of equation B. Why is B better than A? Because exponential i omega t has the property that no matter how many times you differentiate it, it remains the same form, only multiplied by a constant. So therefore it's easier to solve.After you solve B, you take the real part, then you get a solution of A. So that's what I went through too fast. Third point. Last time we talked about the solution of A. Now let us write down the homogeneous equation.I call this C. This is called the homogeneous equation. Homogeneous meaning that there's no term not proportional to x or x dot or x double dot. Namely, there is no f term.Now, any solution of A plus any solution of C is still a solution of A. Does everybody agree? If I take a solution, any solution of A, add to it any solution of C, I now use that sum, and I want to prove that that sum satisfies this equation. Obviously, because when you take the left-hand side, suppose this one is called, the solution of this one is called x1. The solution of this is called x2.Now I take x1 plus x2. If you take x1 plus x2 and substitute on the left-hand side, the x2 power drops out because of this. So you are left with x1, so you get the equation of... So let me write it down.Any solution x1 of A plus any solution x2 of C is a solution of A. And that is called a general solution. So a general solution always consists of an x1 plus an x2. But the x1 part we already discussed the last time is an exponential i omega t. When you take the real part, it becomes a cosine.It doesn't damp down. As t goes to infinity, x1 does not damp. Does not damp down.

X2 is a solution of C. We talked about that it damps down with an exponential decrease of the amplitude. So therefore, X2 does damp down. It does not.

It does. So after a sufficient long time, there's only X1 left. So every time you turn a switch, all the electrical connections form a network.And next semester, you're going to learn that that satisfies the equation exactly like this, like this equation A. And when you turn a switch on, immediately the current flowing through it consists of two terms, X1 and X2. The X2 part is called transient. Transient to transient.That part will die down in time, and only the X1 part is left. And this is true of all vibrations. Section 17-3 is very interesting.I didn't know it. It tells you how a scholar measures distance. This must be a new discovery of the last 20 years.It shows how very advanced the techniques are used by various animals and insects. Now in this chapter and the next chapter, 17 and 18, we're talking about waves. Waves are different from what we have been talking about, is that it's a function of two variables.It's not just a function of T, but it's a function of X and T. For example, a vibrating string. So every point here, this is called Y. Every point here is moving up and down. So Y is a function of both X and T. And if it's a drum, then the surface of the drum would be moving.So you would have Z of X, Y, T. A typical vibration is like this. Y is equal to Y0 times sine or cosine of omega T plus 5. Y0 is called amplitude. This is called phase.Omega is called angular frequency, sometimes called angular velocity. Sorry, sorry. Plus minus omega T. For a fixed T, it's a sinusoidal wave.What's the wavelength? The wavelength is usually called the lambda. If you increase X by lambda, the phase should increase by 2 pi. That's the definition of a cycle.So K times lambda has to be equal to 2 pi. So lambda is related to K by 2 pi over... T is called period. Period means for a fixed point, X is... So your fixed point, fixed X. Then when T increases by capital T, by the period, it should increase by 2 pi.So omega times T is equal to 2 pi. So therefore T is equal to 2 pi over omega. 1 over T is the number of seconds, number of cycles per unit time.For example, suppose T is 1 over 1,000 of a second. Then in one second, you can have 1,000 cycles. So 1 over T is called frequency.In the book, it's called f. Usually in the physics literature, one does not use f, one uses nu, the Greek letter nu. But in the book, because nu looks very much like V, for reasons I did not understand, they chose a font, a font. The font in the book, V, is the same as nu.So in the book, they don't use nu for frequency, they use f. But usually in the physics literature, frequency is used for nu. And then we follow the book. So T is equal to 1 over f. Suppose it's f of kx minus omega t. What kind of function is this? This is x, this is y, this is f. This is when T is equal to 0. Now I increase T a little bit.Then this point would move forward. So when T increases, the whole curve is moved to the right. This is when T is equal to 0. This is when T is equal to delta T. In other words, the whole wave is going in the opposite direction.Now the f of kx minus omega t is a wave that moves to the right. F of kx plus omega t is a wave that moves to the left. Is that clear? Because f of 0 is when T is equal to 0. So f of 0 is when x is equal to 0. When T is equal to 1, if you also use f of 0, then you have to put kx minus omega is equal to 0. Then you say that x is equal to omega over k. To the right, with velocity, is equal to omega over k. This is with velocity, with speed, omega over k. Speed is the absolute value.So now there is an important formula. Omega over k is equal to speed. To the left or to the right depends on whether it's kx minus omega t or kx plus omega t. All these are elementary, but you have to go through this argument once.It's very simple. Notice that the shape of the wave is not changed. Either f of kx minus omega t or f of kx plus omega t, they represent waves which move to the right or to the left without changing shape.No matter how original it looks like, it doesn't change shape. Actually, if you watch a water wave in the ocean, the surface water wave does move. If the bottom is not sloped, if the bottom is fixed, then for a long stretch of distance, the wave moves without changing shape.The reason that you usually see bai lang, foams, that's because the bottom is sloping upwards, so that the water becomes shallower and shallower. When that is the case, you have the waves that would change shape. Why does it change shape? It's actually very simple.Because there's a drag of the water at the bottom, and as a consequence, the bottom moves too slow, the top moves too fast, so it accumulates, so eventually it tops over. As a matter of fact, if the slope is very gentle, and if the speed is just right, it will become a tidal wave. A tidal wave is a very famous phenomenon.There are a few places in the world where there is something like Qiantangjiang Dachao. And in the 19th century, people in the science of hydrodynamics, they understood this. So there are books and books written about how Qiantangjiang Dachao was formed.And the fundamental point is that it has to be a gently sloping bottom. Now we are going to move on to a subject which is not discussed properly in the book. For example, a piano string.This is the picture I just drew. When the string is moving, it may look like this. It satisfies a certain equation.The book did not discuss this equation because the book avoided the use in differential calculus. Instead, the book gave a very tricky derivation of the velocity. I studied that derivation.It is essentially correct, but it's too tricky. And it's not the right way to teach that particular problem. So we are going to analyze this problem.And we look at one particular... This is the string. This is the original position. And now we look at a segment of it.The string has a tangent, which is tau. The string has a mu, which is equal to mass per length. So I'm now going to look at a small segment of it, from x to x plus dx.x plus delta x. Horizontal force on string at x. This is negative. Minus tau. Tau is the force.Times... Not horizontal, vertical. Sorry. Vertical force on the string at the point x is equal to negative tau times sine theta.This curve is like this. I call the slope angle theta. T sine theta is the force's vertical component.Because theta is small, we are talking about a small vibration. So sine theta is equal to tangent theta. I'll write it like this.Sine theta at the point x. Tangent theta. At the point x. Which is equal to minus tau. What is the tangent theta? Tangent theta is the derivative.dy dx at the point x. Vertical force on string at x plus delta x. That is at this point. Similarly, the same expression at delta x plus delta x. But we changed the sign. Because this side is up and that side is down.So it's equal to plus tau dy dx at x plus delta x. So the total vertical force on string in this interval is equal to tau times dy dx at x plus delta x minus dy dx at x. Okay, let us plot. This is x. Let us plot dy dx. y is a function of x. This is the string.It has a derivative. The derivative is like this. So we take the derivative at this point.Minus the derivative at this point. Now I claim this is equal to tau times dy squared y dx squared at x plus delta x. Because this difference is the derivative. This is the tangent direction.This is the angle direction. But when delta x is very small, these two are the same. So therefore, in the limit, it becomes like this.We now neglect gravity. Now we have a Newton's law. Mass.The string is here. Its mass per unit length is mu. So mu delta x is equal to mass.Multiply by acceleration. d squared y dt squared. This is acceleration.Mass times acceleration should be equal to force. So we get, finally, what I said then, take it as a weight equation. It's a most important equation.The book gave a tricky derivation of this velocity. I had never seen that derivation before. I studied it.

It's correct. But it's too tricky. It's not the right way to learn it.The right way to learn it is what I told you. This is the right way to derive this weight equation. Take equation.Sometimes it's written in a different way. One writes one v squared. Sometimes we introduce this notation.Differentiate with a t. Write a subscript t. Two t is the second derivative with respect to time. Equal to yxx. yxx is the second derivative of y with respect to x. ytt is the second derivative of y with respect to t. These are different ways of writing the weight equation.This is a problem with two dimensions. One space x, one time t. You can write a weight equation in four dimensions. Weight equation in three plus one dimension.Three plus one dimension means three space coordinates. One time coordinate, that's the real space. And that equation becomes one over v squared times ytt, not y, times, let's say, a field, f. Phi.Phi tt is equal to phi xx plus phi yy plus phi zz. That's the weight equation in three dimensions. Before 1865, there was the science of optics, guangxue.And it was already known. People had already measured the velocity of light. And it turns out to be approximately the value we have today, which is three times ten to the eighth meters per second.In 1865, Maxwell wrote down Maxwell's three, four equations, or Maxwell's equations. He then manipulated with those equations, eventually found an equation like this, with a velocity which came from his equations. His equations were derived from electricity and magnetism.So the v that he calculated came from electrodynamics. He observed that velocity is approximately equal to the experimentally observed velocity of light. So in his paper, he said he believes that the electromagnetic, that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.And that was one of the great moments in the history of mankind. Because after that, one knows that there are electromagnetic waves, which was not known before, and that in fact optics or light waves are electromagnetic waves. And of course, that discovery, that understanding,

It gave rise to radio, to the internet, to all the communications that we use today. And furthermore, one understands that there are other types of waves. There are microwaves, there are ultraviolet waves, there are x-rays, there are gamma rays.All of them are electromagnetic waves. And they all satisfy fundamentally an equation like this. For example, if you have a drum.I just talked about this drum. There is x, y. Its displacement is z of x, y, t. It satisfies the equation 1 over v squared, ztt is equal to zxx plus zyy. A pipe, whether it is a sealed pipe or a loose pipe.When you blow a flute, the air mass inside moves back and forth. And the density of air, rho, becomes a function of x and t. And that rho satisfies 1 over v squared, rho, tt is equal to rho, xx. Okay, now let's try to solve this equation.Not in general, but we discuss what is called a standing wave. We take the original equation. It is a string.We assume that y is a product function. It is a product of a of x times b of t. It was originally a function of two variables. We assume that it is a product of two functions.One of which depends only on x. The other depends only on t. Okay, let's substitute that in here. We get 1 over v squared. The tt, so I get x times the second derivative of b with respect to t. That's the left-hand side.The right-hand side is the double derivative with respect to x. And single, without derivative. So, we move everything that depends on t to one side. So we get b, t, divided by b of t, times 1 over v squared, is a. Now, this is a very peculiar equation.On the left side, you have a function of t. On the right side, you have a function of x. And it's supposed to be valid for all values of x and all values of t. So, what's the conclusion? This equation, on the left side, is a function of t. On the right side, it's a function of x. And it's valid for all values of x and all values of t. Does anybody know how to conclude? Or claim? This thing must be equal to a constant. Independent of anything. Why? I fix a t. I change x. Because you fix a t, so you can't change anything.Because you don't change the right side. No. If I fix a t and change x, no matter how you change x, it's still the same t. So you don't change the left side, so you can't change the right side.So on the right side, it's independent of x. Both sides must be the same constant. Because, let me tell you. This expression, if you look at it from the left side, it's a function of t. That means it's independent of x. If you look at it from the right side, it's independent of t. So it's neither independent of x nor of t. So it must be a constant.So it's minus k squared. Why do I write it as minus k squared instead of plus k squared? You can see it in a minute. Plus k squared is also fine.But it's of no interest to us. Now, let me write the right side. a double prime x is equal to minus k squared a of x. That's our old friend.It's a harmonic motion. If it's a plus sign, it will become an exponential motion. We have also discussed that.And we don't want to have very large solutions. So we just take the minus one. So therefore, we get the a of x. So then a zero sign of k x plus five.Similarly, the left side tells us p double x. p double t is equal to minus k squared v squared b of t. Which we shall write as omega squared b of t. Where we take omega equal to kv. If k squared is not negative but plus, then this becomes plus. Then the time derivative becomes exponential.We don't discuss such... There are such solutions, but they are of no interest to us. So therefore, we get the b is a sinusoidal wave. So it's a product of a sinusoidal function with respect to x times a sinusoidal function with respect to t. This is a string.Now let's talk about the space dependence boundary condition. If x is a string, then x equals zero. This point is x equals zero.When x is equal to zero, it stops. So y is equal to zero. When x is equal to L, y is also equal to zero.This is the boundary condition. You put the boundary condition here. Then phi is equal to zero.So a of x is equal to a zero. Sine of kx. Since x is equal to zero, it's equal to zero.Rkl. Sine of kl is equal to zero. So kl is equal to n pi.n equals 1, 2, 3. When n equals 1, the solution is sine of pi over Lx. So when x is equal to zero, it's zero. When x is equal to L, it's pi.So it's like this. When n equals 2, ax is equal to a zero sine of 2 pi over Lx. When x is equal to L, it's equal to 2 pi.Sine of 2 pi. So it's like this. When n equals 3, a of x. When x is equal to L, it's equal to 3 pi.In this situation, what is lambda equal to? We have a formula for lambda. Lambda is equal to 2 pi over k. So it's equal to 2 pi. Then 2L over n. This is 17.52. So here, lambda is equal to 2L.Here, lambda is equal to L. Here, lambda is equal to 2L over 3. Do you agree? This is equal to 2L. Because this is only half a wave. So the whole wave is 2L.The whole wave is 2L. In this situation, this is a wave. So lambda is equal to L. In this situation, this is a wave.This is half a wave. So L is equal to half a wave. So from here to here is a wavelength.Of course, it's 2L over 3. Just now, I only talked about A. We still have to multiply B. To multiply B, we have to multiply it by a sinusoidal wave. But the whole thing is multiplied by a sinusoidal wave. So if A is like this, the frequency of the whole thing is the same.For example, when B is positive, it's like this. When B is negative, it's like this. So every point is here.So if this is a string, when it's vibrating, if you look at it, because it moves very fast, you can only see these two sides. You can see that it's like this. In this situation, it becomes like this.This kind of place is called a node. The place where the vibration is zero is called a node. So in this situation, there are nodes on both sides.There is also a node in the middle of this situation. When you add an N, there are two nodes in the middle, etc. And this frequency is equal to MV over 2L.B is equal to square root of tau over mu. We already have that equation. This is the 17th day.If you look at the piano, for every key of the piano, there is a string. And the different strings are of different lengths and of different tension. They are adjusted such that the fundamental frequency is equal to the frequency you want for that key.When you strike a key, all of these vibrations... What we found is one solution, say, for N equal to 1. You can also have a solution for N equal to 2. But any linear superposition, the equation is linear. The wave equation is linear. So if you have one solution of the wave equation, if you have another solution of the wave equation, if you add the two, it is still a solution.So that means you can have the different frequencies all occurring at the same time. So when you strike a key, the C key of the piano, you get the fundamental frequency, but you also get higher frequencies. The higher frequencies are the multiples of that frequency, according to this formula.What determines the ratio of the different frequencies? That is determined in a very complicated manner. It depends on how you strike it. It depends on where you strike it, how you strike it.So it is complicated. For example, if I strike it at this point, at a note, then it's not likely that it will excite this mode. So the ratio of the different frequencies the different frequencies are in integral ratios of each other, according to this formula.But it depends on where you strike it. They are different ratios of the amplitudes. And in general, and also it depends on whether you strike it just at one instant of time, or it's a somewhat longer time.A piano, when it strikes, it has a certain volume. So it's a very complicated thing. And one doesn't do any computations about it.One just listens to it. And one adjusts it such that it's the most pleasing sound. But in general, when you strike one key, it's usually the fundamental frequency.That means the n equal to 1 frequency that's being used. Now if you have a violin, or if you have a huqin, then in a violin or in a huqin, you change L because one hand moves and changes the L. One end of the string is fixed. The other end is fixed, but you use your hand to create a new boundary condition.So L is changing. By changing L, the frequency, the frequencies depend on L according to our formula. So therefore, you, by putting your finger at different positions, you create different frequencies of sound.And the multiple of the different ends again depends on how you strike it. Then you use a string, the way the string, where you put the string, etc., etc., all create different qualities of sound. Now I want to prove a fundamental statement.A standing wave, a standing wave is a sum of two traveling waves, equals sine kx cosine omega t. For example, we all know this is equal to one half of sine kx minus omega t plus sine of kx plus omega t. This is a simple trigonometric formula. This is a vibration that we have been talking about. It's a standing wave.Standing wave because it's like this. It's fixed. It's the same shape, only the amplitude is vibrating with time.That's called a standing wave. But if you write it in this fashion, this is a wave that moves to the right. This is a wave that moves to the left.So a standing wave is actually a sum of two traveling waves. It has to be this way because any solution of the wave equation is always a sum of a standing wave plus of, is always a sum of two traveling waves in opposite directions. Because the sum of a traveling wave this way plus a traveling wave this way is a general solution.Any solution of the equation is a sum of two such traveling waves. So this is not a surprise. So we now know, in some sense, the physics of a stream vibration.But what we discussed is a case where the boundary condition is that the y is equal to 0 on this end and y is equal to 0 on this end. There are other boundary conditions. First case, at x equal to 0, we have y equal to 0. At x equal to L, we have y equal to 0. That's the case that we talked about.A second case is y equal to 0 at one end and dy dx is equal to 0 at the other end. How do we make this? You make this in a string like this. At this end, it's fixed.At the other end, you allow it to move, but you make its derivative fixed. So you can do a... You can have something like this, which can move. So it can be like this.The best thing is it's a pipe. A pipe with one end fixed, the other end open. Because if the pipe is open at one end, then the air there can freely move.If the air can freely move, it means its density is fixed. That means d density dx is equal to 0. So that's this equation. So an open pipe satisfies this.If it's open on both ends, that's this one. So this is a fixed string on both ends. This is a pipe with one end closed, one end open.This is a pipe with both ends open. So we have possibilities of all three kinds. You can read the section 18-6.Let us go through the case of case 3. Pipe open at both ends. The equation is the same. We write 1 over v squared ytt equal to yxx.We again write y as ax times bt. We again get 1 over v squared btt is equal to axx is equal to minus k squared. So a double x is equal to minus k squared a of x and a of x is a sinusoidal wave.A sinusoidal wave, you can always either write it as a sine or as a cosine. But we shall write it as. We want dy dx equals.

So it's better to write cosine. So I write this as a0. Cosine kx, when you differentiate, becomes minus sine kx, where x equal to 0 is 0. So it's easier to choose.You can choose anything, but you have to follow through the rules. And it turns out that if you choose cosine, the results in the calculation are much simpler. And this satisfies A prime of 0 is equal to 0. The other end is A prime of dA dx.When you differentiate y, you only differentiate A. So dA dx at x equal to L has to be equal to 0. That's the other boundary condition. That means A0 minus A0 k sine of kl is equal to 0. So kl is equal to m pi. That means k is equal to m pi over L. n is equal to 1, 2. Lambda is equal to 2 pi over k is equal to 2L over n. The frequency is equal to nv over 2L.So let's take n equal to 1. n equal to 1, k is equal to pi over L. So A is equal to cosine k pi over L. It's like this. And it's equal to one. So A is equal to a zero cosine of pi over L X. n equal to 2. A is equal to A0 cosine 2 pi over L X. In this case, lambda is equal to 2L.In this case, lambda is equal to L. So A is equal to 3. A is equal to A0 cosine 3 pi over L. So we talk about 3 pi. 3 pi, what does it mean? Everybody happy? I think, in fact, that you have all had this in high school. The only thing that you didn't have is the wave equation.Now we have today derived the wave equation and the soft equation for the standing wave case. So that's the difference between what you are learning now and what you have already learned in high school. And I'm sure the three boundary conditions you are also very aware of.The only thing different is that you learn the origin of it starting from the wave equation. Now let us discuss a problem of chapter 17. Problem 51P.The problem is a string. This string is a little strange. It consists of two different materials.The total length is L. Part of it is of one material. Part of it is of another material. Tau is, of course, fixed.The tension is fixed. Let's investigate what happens. The differential equation that we have remains the same.So we still have mu d squared y dt squared is equal to tau d squared y dt squared. So I still have the same equation. But v is not a constant.v is equal to a function of x. The v in this section is one value. The v in this section is another value. v is equal to v1 for x less than L1.v is equal to v2 for x greater than L1. So the equation is the same. Only the v is dependent on x. So we still do the same thing.We write y is equal to a of x, b of t. And we still have the same equation, which is a double x v squared of x divided by a of x is equal to b divided by t times bt. This is the same as before. The only thing is that the v now depends on x. Again, the left side does not depend on t. So the whole thing doesn't depend on t. The right side does not depend on x. So the whole thing doesn't depend on x. So the whole thing doesn't depend on either x or t. So it's equal to a constant.So it's equal to minus. Omega is a fixed number. You know that omega is not a function of x. So we have b double t equal to minus omega squared bt.That means b is harmonic. b is sinusoidal in t. So that's a harmonic motion. So this string, if you strike it, it won't produce any sound.The sound depends only on the frequency. So therefore it's like an ordinary string. The quality may be different because the proportion of different harmonics, n equal to 1, n equal to 2, n equal to 3, the proportion might depend on this joint of two materials.But the a equation becomes now more complicated because we now have a double x is equal to minus omega squared over v squared, which is a function of x times a of x. All we write it as a x is going to minus K one squared a of x for x less than L one a double x equal to minus K two squared. A of x for x greater than L one. So in each region we have a sinusoidal wave, but the K, that means the wavelengths are different.So for x less than L one and x greater than L one, we have in each a sinusoidal wave, but with different Ks. That is to say with different wavelengths. So now we have to match them.This is a typical tidal problem. We have to match these two waves at x one. We have to match these two waves at the x and L one.What is meant by that? That means that the region, the y, the x one different, the region, the y, the region, the derivative of y. In other words, y is continuous at x equal to L one and d y d x is continuous at x equal to L one. This is called matching. OK, I think we better do this next time.This gets a little bit complicated. After we match, we'll find the complete solution. The complete solution, however, also the amplitude of the two sides have to be matched.If you have a uniform string, then the vibration amplitude at every point is given by that A. But now you have two different amplitudes for the two different regions. They are each sinusoidal, but they may not be the same. And also there's a face difference.So this is a little bit complicated. We'll do that next time. We will finish this discussion next time.OK, let us start from what we left off last time. This exercise, it's a string which consists of two different material. So the equation is still this.But V squared is equal to V one squared for X less than L one is V squared is equal to V two squared for X greater than L one. So we similarly take a Y is equal to A of X times B of D. Then we get A double X divided by A of X times V squared of X is equal to B. The left both sides are functions of X and T, but the left side is independent of T. The right side is independent of X. So therefore, the whole thing is independent of either T or X. So it's equal to a numerical constant and we write it as minus omega squared. How about if it's a plus omega squared? You can study that.If you study that, you will see that this part, the T equation, would give you an exponentially increasing or decreasing solution, and that's not interesting. So we only study the case where it's negative. And therefore, B becomes harmonic.That's exactly the same as the usual case. What is interesting is the A part. So the A part gives us this equation.For the two regions, we have two different equations. And we also have the boundary condition that A of X is equal to zero for X equal to zero. And A at L1 plus L2 is equal to zero for X equal to L1 plus L2.Because the string is fixed at these two points. So if we use that to solve this equation, we get A of X is equal to A zero sine. You can have a cosine also, but the cosine part must be zero in order to satisfy the first boundary condition.Similarly, we can write on the next one. This is for X less than L1. For the right end, for the large X, we get omega over V2 times X. But we want to put the boundary condition in.And when X is equal to L1 plus L2, it has to be equal to zero. So it's obviously it's this. Because if we write it this way, when X is equal to L1 plus L2, automatically it's a zero.In other words, the way we write it already has the boundary condition built in. Now we do matching. Matching is to match.No, matching is to match. It's where L1 is. A of L1 is equal to continuous.A prime of L1 is equal to continuous. us. For x less than L1 and x greater than L1, we should make this equal to.So we get A0 sine omega over V1 of L1 is equal to A1 sine omega over V2 of minus L2. And if we take the derivative, we get A0 omega over V1 cosine of omega over V1 L1 is equal to A1 times omega over V2 times cosine of minus L2. The first equation is the matching of A. The second is the matching of A prime.

Now let us divide these two equations so as to eliminate the A0 and A1. So I get, and we can eliminate the omega because we have omega on both sides. So we get V1 cotangent of omega over V1 L1 is equal to 1 over V2 of cotangent of L2 with a minus sign.

This equation determines omega. I had not known this before, that if you have a string with two different kinds of material so that the velocity is different, you would get a very complicated equation like this. Let us take the case of L1 over V1 is equal to L2 over V2.

V1 and V2 depend on the material. The book uses iron and aluminum. So once you have V1 and V2, you can choose L1 and L2 to be equal such that this is true.

In that case, you get 1 over V1 plus 1 over V2 times cotangent of omega V1 L1 is equal to 0. So this is equal to 0. That is very interesting. You would get omega equal to a series of possibilities and you have the integer n in it. But in general, so that is this case.

In general, let us call this equation alpha. In general, alpha gives and you get the lowest solution for omega and the next lowest solution of omega may not have an integral ratio of each other. So I did not know this before.

I did not know that if you have a string which consists of two different material, if you plug it in general, it may create sounds which are very peculiar and may not be harmonious. Any questions about this particular problem? One lesson that you can learn from this is that when you have complicated equations, if you choose your steps carefully, the equations may become very simple. For example, here the reason that we got to this simple result, relatively simple result, is because we chose these two very cleverly.

If you did not do it, if you put a face in it, you get more complicated looking equations and then things would not be so simple. So one thing that you should remember when you do an exercise or when you take an exam is to choose your notations and your strategy carefully. If you do that well, things simplify.

If you do that not so well, you get more complicated.

Things become more and more complicated. Okay, now we go to the next chapter. The waves that we have been talking about are called transverse waves.Because the direction of the motion is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the waves. But there are also longitudinal waves. And sound waves is one example.If I draw a wave front, these are called wave fronts. When sound waves travel, the air molecules vibrate at every point. But they do not all vibrate at the same time in one direction.So this is where the density of waves is high. And these are called wave fronts. These are the crests, crests being maximum density.So this is maximum density, this is maximum density. And at the next moment, the maximum density will propagate. So it moves this way.Water waves is a transverse wave, not a longitudinal wave. But it has crests which move along. So these sound waves are longitudinal waves, for example.In the next 20 minutes, I'm going to derive the equation of motion for the sound waves. The book has a derivation. It's difficult to understand.What we are going to go through is much simpler once you have understood it. And it's more general. What we are going to go through, in contrast to what the book tells you, is a bit like deriving Newtonian planetary motion by calculus compared with deriving Newtonian planetary motion by geometry.The derivation by geometry are always tricky and complicated, and in some sense useless, because you cannot use it in the future. While the derivation by calculus, once you have understood it, is much simpler. And furthermore, it allows you to make further progress.So it may look difficult, but actually it's simpler. So we are going to go through a derivation of a wave equation for sound. I think in high school you have all learned that the reason that there is sound is because there's longitudinal vibration of the air molecules.So we try to write down the equations. First, the lowest density of air molecules. u is horizontal velocity.u is a function of x and t. Rho is also a function of x and t. The sound wave moves along the x direction. First, we are going to write down the equation of continuity. Rho times u with respect to x derivative plus rho with respect to time derivative is equal to zero.This equation is very important. In fact, the way Maxwell developed Maxwell's equations, in 1865, Maxwell derived Maxwell's equations. He had been working on that for several years.But it was in 1865 that he wrote down the right equation. The way that he wrote down the right equation is deeply related to this equation. Only he was not talking about sound waves.He was talking about the conservation of charge. This is the equation of continuity. Or it is the conservation of mass.It's the equation of the conservation of mass. When Maxwell wrote down the equation for the conservation of charge, and because of that, he introduced what is called a displacement current. And because of that introduction, he was able to derive what I told you once before already, that there's electromagnetic waves out of his equations.And he can calculate the velocity of electromagnetic waves from his equations. And that velocity turns out to be almost the velocity of the known light velocity. At that time, there was no accurate measure of the velocity of light.And he noticed that the velocity of light is the same as the wave velocity out of his equations. So he said that light is, in fact, the electromagnetic waves. That's a historical event in the history of mankind.So this equation is extremely important, and it's extremely easy to derive. Because if I think of this motion, if I think of a column of air, and I ask, air is moving. So air mass is moving in, and air mass is moving out.The question that I want to ask is, the number, the mass that moves out, the mass that moves out at B is equal to what? In time, delta t is equal to rho U A delta t at x plus delta x. U delta t, in time interval delta t, this sheet moves to here. So this mass moves out. A U delta t is the volume.The volume times rho is the mass that moves out at x plus delta x. The mass that moves in at A in delta t is rho U A delta t at x. So the net, of course, is rho U A delta t, the derivative with respect to x, times delta x. So per unit time, per unit time, net increase of mass is equal to d rho U A d x times delta x. Oh, no, this is negative. Because this is going out. Because this is going out, and this is coming in.So it's a net decrease. This net increase is negative. So this is equal to, it's a net increase.So this is equal to d rho d t. The mass inside is A rho delta x d d t. So when you cancel out A and delta x, it becomes an equation. So it's a U x. This equation is one of the simplest and the fundamental equation of fluid motion. It says there's a conservation of mass.The air mass can be moving in all directions. This is one dimension. One dimension of space, one dimension of time.There are three dimensions of space, three dimensions of time. It becomes a divergence of rho U. The other equation we are going to write down is the force equation. The one I just talked about is kinematics.It's only a matter of balancing the mass. We are talking about the mass moving out, mass moving in. The difference relates to how much mass is increasing inside.So that's what we did. Now we want to look at the pressure. We again go back to the one dimension.We want to derive Px is equal to minus rho U t. There is a pressure at this point. If the whole thing is moving uniformly, then these two pressures are the same. So they balance each other.So therefore what's inside suffers no force. And therefore its momentum does not change. But if the pressures are not the same, then you have dP dx.So the left side is the pressure difference, which is the net force on the inside. The right side is the momentum, is the increase of momentum. So this equation merely says the net force on this sheet is equal to minus P is the net force.Because if the pressure on this side is big and the pressure on this side is small, then of course the net force is negative. So this is the net force on that sheet. And the right side is the time change of momentum.So that's Newton's equation. Is everybody happy? Okay. What we have done is we have written down in one dimension, one space dimension, one time dimension, the two fundamental equations of hydrodynamics.We are going to talk about small vibrations. Small vibration means that the rho and u are small. The u and the derivative of u are small.Rho is not small. But the rho of the change is small. Rho is not small.But the rho of the derivative, rho u, rho x, and rho t are small. When there is a sound, the velocity, the density of air, it remains the usual density. But there is a small vibration, so there is smaller changes.So these are small. Then let the rho of the density, which is general rho zero, is not small. The pressure, the value of pressure, P zero is not small.Because Px, Px, Pt are small. Does everybody understand what I'm saying? It's actually very obvious. So we are now going to process these equations, but neglect higher orders.We shall examine the two equations, neglecting all second order terms. The two small quantities, we shall neglect them. Of course, we shall neglect zero order, first order, and higher order.Let's see what this becomes. First, let's look at this equation. The ux is small.Rho x, rho t is small. This rho is equal to rho zero plus rho change. But that change, the u on top, becomes second order.So we forget about that change. So I write it like this. Is everybody happy? Then let's look at the equation below.The equation below is Px plus rho u t plus rho t u. This is small, this is small, this is small. The change is small. We can ignore this, because it's automatically second order.This is the same as before. We can write it as rho zero. What we are doing is called perturbation theory.Perturbation is the spirit that you divide all the quantities into different orders. Then you study each order. That was developed in the 18th century by many people, but especially Laplace and Lagrange, because it's very rare that you can solve an exact problem.Newton solved the motion of planetary orbits. That was very lucky. But if you talk about a three-body problem, you cannot solve it.There's no general solution. And yet people had to study the motion of the planets or of the moon. So how do you do it? You develop the perturbation idea.So perturbation theory was developed greatly in the 18th century, and that still has been developed today. Hydrodynamics is a very complicated subject, and people use different ideas about perturbation. So the spirit of perturbation is one of the pervading spirits in applied mathematics.In this particular case, the perturbation theory is very simple. So now what do we do about P? So we write P as P0 plus delta P. And Px, therefore, is d delta P dx. This is small, first order.Now P is a function of rho. When air vibrates, if there's a local increase of density, then locally the pressure would increase. So let us assume that pressure is a function of rho.There's some certainty about this, so we'll come to that. P is a function of rho, so therefore P of dP dx is equal to dP d rho, d rho dx. Now d rho dx is small.dP d rho is not small. So if we do it first order, it becomes like this. So this can be written as dP dx d rho.This is called compressibility. Plus rho x. This is small. So this equation becomes dP d rho zero.This has nothing to do with sound waves. This has nothing to do with sound waves. This is the pressure.This is the compressibility of the mass. When the density changes, how does the pressure increase? So this becomes rho x times rho zero u t equals zero. This equation now looks very nice because first, this is a number.It doesn't depend on P. It doesn't depend on T. It doesn't depend on x. This is a number. This is a number. So these coefficients are all numbers.And what we have are these first order relations. Now if I take the derivative of this one, I take u rho zero u tT is equal to minus dP d rho zero rho xt from the first equation. Now from the second equation, this is equal to minus dP d rho zero of rho zero uxx plus.So we get u tT is equal to dP d rho zero uxx. This is our old friend, the wave equation and the velocity.

This is the equation 18-3 in the book. Only it's written in a very peculiar form in the book. So that's the sound velocity.

Let me say again, dp d rho is a property of the air. When you increase air density, its pressure increases. But now we want to introduce another concept.

It's called adiabatic. In the sound propagation, in this analysis, when sound waves compress, when the sound wave propagates, there's a local change of density. So air is all the time being compressed and decompressed and so on and so forth.In that process, there's no heat flow. When sound waves compress air, there is no heat flow. No heat flow because heat flow is very slow.

And when there's no heat flow, it's called adiabatic. The process is called adiabatic. So dp d rho is evaluated for an adiabatic compression.So normally this should be written as adiabatic. Let's try the dimension here. Let's look at dp d rho, the dimension of dp d rho.This notation means dimension. What is the dimension of pressure? Pressure is force per unit area. The dimension of force per unit area is like this.Rho is mass per unit volume. Force is mass times acceleration. Mass times length times time squared.And this is L and this is M. These are all eliminated. So it's L squared over T squared. So it's equal to V squared.So that's right. You should look at table 18E. It tells you the velocity.Air, usually V is equal to 331 meters per second. In water, if you compress the water, it's very resistant. So the velocity is much larger.Velocity is 14 bar meters per second. Steel, it's harder to compress. So it's 5941.That increasing is perfectly in agreement with our daily experience. So, I want you in the last 20 minutes to learn two things. First, these two equations, these two fundamental equations.One is the equation of continuity. The other is the equation which balances pressure force on one side and the momentum change on the other side. And I also want you to learn how to deal with such an equation by perturbation.Such an equation is very complicated. It's not linear. But by thinking of things in perturbation orders and just neglect the higher order terms, you get a linear equation, and therefore it becomes a wave equation.So that spirit of doing perturbation is something that you will be learning repeatedly if you want to become a physicist, also if you want to become an engineer. The phenomenon of interference you are very familiar with. You all know that if you have water waves, if you have two sources of water waves, then they interfere.So, just read the book here. For traveling waves, like sound waves, the usual sound waves, there is energy generated by the motion. The small vibrations generate energy, and it flows.In fact, you know if you have a very large loudspeaker, you can feel the force coming together with the sound. And the book gives a sort of a half-derivation. So I will not go into that in detail.Read that section. It's 18.27. Rho V. V is the velocity. Omega is the angular frequency squared.SM squared is the maximum vibrational amplitude. The air molecules in a, for example, in a loudspeaker, they are vibrating, and this is the amplitude of the vibration. There is a unit of sound volume.It's called decibels. The key formula is that the decibel scale is equal to 10 decibels times log to the base 10 of I over I0, where I0 is 10 to the minus 12 watt per meter squared. This is a very useful section for you to read, because then you would know what is meant by 30 decibel sound volume or 50 decibels.If you have a pipe and the pipe, if both ends are sealed, closed pipe, the closed end means U is equal to 0. Here, the air can neither move forward nor backward, so U is equal to 0. The open end means DU DX is equal to 0. There is a maximum DU, a maximum U, a minimum DU DX. In this context, for example, read the derivations of 18-38 and 18-39. For different pipes, we had roughly talked about this.Both ends closed, you get the frequency distribution is one kind. One end closed, one end open is another kind. Both ends open is a third kind.Suppose we have two frequencies, omega 1 and omega 2, with a small difference, omega 1 minus omega 2. Omega 1 minus omega 2 is much less than omega 1 and omega 2. So what is the sum? The sum is A cosine omega 1 t plus cosine omega 2 t. If the amplitudes of these two are different, the phenomenon of beat is not as clear. It's most clear if they are the same amplitude. Then you get the sum of the formula.You get 2 cosine omega 1 plus omega 2 t plus cosine omega 1 minus omega 2 t. Because that's cos, cos, minus, sin, sin, minus, sin, sin. And therefore the, no, one half, sorry. No, no, no, no.

Complete wrong. That's not possible. It's equal to.This is not right. Now, this is still almost the same frequency. If omega 1 and omega 2 are about the same.This one, however, has a very small frequency. So this frequency is like this. This is a very large frequency.So the result is like this. This is determined by this. This part vibrates inside.From here to here, this is one frequency. So from here to here, it's 2 pi divided by one half omega 1 minus omega 2. This is time. From here to here, it's determined by this.This one cycle is 2 pi. So 2 pi divided by one half of the difference. So from here to here, it's half of it.In this situation, the way you hear is this beat. This is called beat. And so what is this frequency? So the beat frequency is equal to 1 over 2 pi over delta omega.So the beat frequency is equal to f1 minus f2. Then there's a factor of 2. It's because from here to here, it's shortened to this. The beat.If there's a sound wave moving in the air, it's like this. These are the wave fronts. You can hear it here.If this person is moving, then it's obvious. If this person is moving in the opposite direction, the frequency he hears is bigger. If he's moving in the opposite direction, the frequency he hears is smaller.Similarly, if the source is moving, then this whole thing has an additional velocity due to the motion of the source. So this is called Doppler effect. It was discovered in the mid-19th century.I'm sure you have learned it in high school. So the new frequency is equal to the old frequency. The new V plus, plus minus V detector, D-degree detector, V plus minus VS, S should be the source.I know that you have all learned in high school already. Suppose there's an object which moves faster than the velocity of sound. Then, when it's moving at this point, the sound comes out.After one second, the velocity moves. But it's already here. The supersonic airplane is like this.So this creates a shock wave. Because at the next moment, when it's here, it's smaller. When it's here, this shock wave is the angle.This velocity is the velocity of sound. This velocity is the velocity of the airplane. So this distance is the V source.Under this condition, you see this is a triangle. So sine of theta is equal to V divided by V source. If it moves one more minute, the airplane will become like this.So there's a way to detect the shock wave. The shock wave moves like this. When a very fast jet plane goes through, you can hear this very sharp motion.The hydrodynamics of shock wave is a very, very important subject. It's a subject which especially became important because of the war. Okay, we have more or less gone through the mechanics part of the book.Before we embark on the next chapters, these are thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, we have to review a little bit. What we have learned so far, something like nine weeks or ten weeks, consists of material that you already knew, most of you, from high school physics. But we have also learned a number of things which are not in high school physics.I thought about it this morning, and I'm going to write them down. Moment of inertia. We went much more deeply into the subject of moment of inertia.Especially we said that if you have a body, a complicated rigid body, it has three principal axes of inertia, and with three principal moment of inertia, I1, I2, I3, and I1, I2, I3 may not be the same. And that's a very complicated subject. Rotation of gyroscope, planetary motion, damped harmonic oscillator, stream motion, wave equation, sound waves, sound wave equation.Six. These six topics are what are usually not contained in high school physics. I know that some of you got a bit discouraged when you all of a sudden learned something which is a bit complicated.Okay. In order to know how you feel about this, for those who are uncomfortable with the topic of moment of inertia, raise your hand. Everyone understands? I'm surprised.I thought many people feel uncomfortable about these three moment of inertia. It's very simple now.

I would like to ask Mr. Ruan and Mr. An to help me. My question is that what percentage of people think that moment of inertia is a kind of feeling that makes them feel uncomfortable? I asked them and they didn't raise their hands. So everyone is very happy, right? OK, I see.Rotational gyroscope is more complicated. There are more people who are not happy. Rotational gyroscope is not very important.You will learn it in the future. Planetary motion. People say that planetary motion is an ellipse.It is a parabola, a hyperbola. Those derivations are very unhappy. Not many people are unhappy, right? Good.Bent harmonic oscillator. I think this is relatively simple. Maybe some of you already learned it in high school.Stream motion wave equation. So everyone is very happy, right? The most important thing is that I want to know with these more advanced ideas which are actually very simple. You will be learning those things or things like that repeatedly in the next three years.So I'm only exposing you to them now. If you feel very uncomfortable, that's not good. If you feel a little bit uncomfortable, it's fine.Because upon first learning something, it's natural to feel a little bit uncomfortable. But next time you see the same thing, you will feel much more comfortable. I don't know if it's because you are too shy to raise your hand or because you feel that you have learned a lot of these things so you are very happy.Okay, I will change this question. Does anyone want to spend another hour reviewing the previous six subjects? Which one are you advocating? The first two. I don't understand.They said the first two. The first two. Someone said the last two.Someone advocated that we reviewed the moment of inertia and rotation of gyroscope. Does anyone else want to review other subjects? The last two. Stream motion and sound.I think it's like this. Planetary motion and damped harmonic oscillator seem to make everyone happier. Is it because many of you have learned more or less in high school? No.Is it because of some difficulties? For example, differentiating exponential. There is an I on it. This is a problem.This doesn't seem to be a problem. Okay. If you ask me, the most important thing of these subjects, the damped harmonic oscillator is very important because you are going to see it repeatedly.But I'm also sure that that's the easiest for you to learn. The last two subjects, the wave equations, that's very important, and you'll be seeing that repeatedly. So I'll be very happy to review that with you.The first two, about the moment of inertia and rotation of gyroscopes. The problem with the rotation of gyroscopes is very complicated because the mathematics is complicated and it's not completely solved. The general problem is just two complicated nonlinear differential equations.But the moment of inertia is actually very, very simple. You merely have to get acquainted with matrices. And that you have to learn because you will be learning quantum mechanics.And if you do not feel comfortable with matrices, you cannot learn quantum mechanics. So, okay. So we'll review the moment of inertia and review the stream motion and the sound motion.I think all of you are learning linear algebra, right? Have you gotten to diagonalization of square matrices? No. Yes. The discomfort that some of you feel about the moment of inertia is because you are not familiar with the concept of matrices.The concept of matrices is extremely simple. And it's just because you have not been exposed to it. And after you are exposed to it for a while, you'll know that it's very simple and it's essential.Both for physics and for mathematics. Okay, so we'll spend the next ten minutes reviewing something about matrices. To talk about the moment of inertia, we have to write some matrices.The matrices are like this. This is x i, y i, z i. Write it as a column. And then write it as x i, y i, z i. Write it as a row.When you multiply it, it becomes x i squared. x i, y i, x i, z i. This is y i, x i, z i, x i. And then this is y i squared, y i, z i, z i, y i, z i squared. This is... And then if you multiply it by m i, then the sum... This matrix is deeply related to the moment of inertia matrix.The trick is that you can turn a coordinate system. You don't have to... You can just find an x, y, z and write it. You don't have to use this x, y, z. You can find a system such that this evaluation can become a diagonal.Diagonal means that there is no sum. There is only a diagonal element. That's the fundamental point.No matter how the rigid body looks, there always exists one axis, x, y, z, such that using that axis, this sum becomes diagonal. That axis is called... Those around the center of mass. That axis is called principal axis of inertia.To prove that, it depends on a simple theorem. There is an orthogonal transformation. Diagonalize this thing.What is orthogonal transformation? If this matrix is called A, this sum is called A. Of course, every point is a complicated sum. This A is equal to this sum. It's a matrix.This A has a diagonalization. Such that the existing orthogonal matrix becomes 0, 0, 0. These three are our diagonals. This is the theorem.The interpretation of this theorem, or its meaning, is that there is a gamma. Mathematically, there exists an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1 such that it can be used to diagonalize this. The meaning of it is that in that system, there is a system obtained by using the gamma to transform the coordinate.In that system, if you do the evaluation just now, automatically it is diagonal. So that system is principal axis of inertia. So the most important concept is this theorem.What I want to ask now is whether you can prove this theorem or you don't know the meaning of this theorem. Which one is the thing that is difficult to swallow? I think they are all simple. You have not seen it before.About how to prove this theorem, it's a trick. In general, many proofs are unimportant because you don't need to remember the proofs. But in this case, it's good to know the proof because the proof teaches you something.Once you know this proof, you realize the geometrical meaning of what you do. What do I mean? To prove this theorem, any symmetrical real matrix can be transformed into a big I by using a gamma tilde. How to prove this theorem? First, use the eigenvalue.First, take the determinant of A minus lambda I. You don't know the determinant is zero. After the determinant is zero, you get the idea of the eigenvalue. What is the determinant? The absolute value is the determinant.The determinant is zero, which means there is a psi. There exists a psi. This psi is called the eigenvector.This idea is important. If you don't know this, you can't study quantum mechanics. This is the first step of quantum mechanics.It's called the eigenvector. Once you have this eigenvector, you can write A psi equals lambda psi. This is it.Then you take this psi. There are three eigenvectors, so there are three eigenvalues, so there are three eigenvectors. If you connect the three eigenvectors, you get gamma.This idea is extremely important. Let me give you two days. The first question is why there are three moments of inertia and three principal axes, and how to prove that the orthogonal matrix can be diagonalized.The real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized. You can review this. Also, you can review how we derived the string to become the wave equation.Also, you can review how we proved the hydrodynamics equation to become the sound wave. Go back and review this. If you have some fundamental questions, raise it next time.I think this review may be useful to many of you. OK, bye-bye. Don't broadcast.The proof in the book is not good. Our proof is that the orthogonal matrix is like this. If it is a matrix like this, the square of V is equal to the speed.Now I will give you a proof. The solution of this equation is f of x minus Vt plus g of x plus Vt. What is the meaning of this equation? I talked about it last time.If f is like this, the next moment will be like this. So this part represents a wave going like this. No matter what shape the wave is, it goes like this.Similarly, this part represents a wave going like this. So the solution of this equation A is the sum of a wave going to the right plus a wave going to the left. I haven't proved it yet.I just told you what it means. To prove this, we need to divide it into two parts. First, I need to prove that this y corresponds to this equation.The first part is that whatever f and g are, they all correspond to this equation. It is very easy. Just try it and you will know.What is dy dx? It is f prime of x minus Vt plus g prime of x plus Vt. What is yxx? It is the difference between the two equations. It is equal to this plus g double prime of this.What is yt? It is positive with respect to t. yt is equal to V times f prime of x minus Vt plus Vg prime of x plus Vt. What is the difference between the two equations? It is equal to V square f prime of x minus Vt plus V square g double prime of x plus Vt. So, ytt is equal to V square yxx.Just a second. There is a negative sign here. Now it is correct.This is a straightforward differentiation. So far I have only proved half of it. Second, to prove that any solution of A is of the form to prove that any solution of B is of the form of A or to prove that any solution of A is of the form of B is a bit complicated.I will discuss this later. I will prove this later. So, have I answered the first question? The first question is The equation we wrote is like this.Here it is written as V. My impression is that why is it called V? Why is it called Velocity? Because the solution of this equation is like this. The solution is like this. First, it is a wave going to the right.Second, it is a wave going to the left. It is a wave going to the left. So it is Velocity.OK. I will discuss this later. Because this is a bit complicated.Second, the proof in the book says that the point on the wave is seen as the movement on the circle. What does this mean? This is actually a trivial statement. It is a cosine function.It is a cosine of x minus Vt. What does it mean? Let me tell you the reason. If x minus Vt is a phase, then this angle is a phase.Then its cosine is... Instead of thinking of a cosine, you think of a point turning here. Its turning angle is x minus Vt. For example, if you turn t into a fixed point, it will turn when x moves.Or when x is fixed and t is moving, it will turn like this. Then this point is an imaginary point. When this point is turning, its x-coordinate is this cosine.This doesn't mean much in the book. If this wave is not a simple cosine, then this equation doesn't make much sense. It only makes sense when it is a simple cosine.Are you satisfied with my explanation? I didn't explain the meaning of the question. OK, let's look at the next one. How do you calculate the momentum of a spring? There is a calculation in this book.I didn't explain this calculation in detail. You can forget about it. Why do I have to ask? Because he only calculated half of it.He later said that the momentum is the same as the momentum. So this introduces a complicated concept. So this proof only proves half of it.It doesn't make much sense. How much momentum does a wave have? This is a general theory. I don't think we should discuss this now.So I just copied the formula. If there is a question about this on the question paper, you can use that formula. Don't worry about how the formula is derived.The derivation in the book doesn't make much sense. At most, the derivation in the book is correct. But he only derived half of it.The next question is about the momentum of a wave. Can you say it again? Can you use Chinese? I just finished speaking in Chinese. The next question is about the main coordinate line after the rotation, and how it is derived.For example, let me give you an example. There is summation mi, and then xi, yi, zi. xi, yi, zi.This is equal to... After you calculate it, it becomes a matrix. This matrix was called... Was it called J? It was called J. The matrix we are talking about is not called J. It is summation. We have a definition.The definition says that the summation of the matrix mi is a diagonal matrix. Every diagonal element is ri2. ri2 is xi2 plus yi2 plus zi2.Subtract the summation mi from this. The whole thing is a symmetrical matrix. J is real symmetrical.Then we have to diagonalize this matrix. How do we diagonalize it? Consider J minus lambda I. I is 1, 1, 1. Diagonal 1, 1, 1.

Determinant is equal to zero This equation is a cubic equation Because you write it out It becomes and this is something something It is equal to this determinant is equal to zero OK, you expand this determinant You know what to do when you expand a determinant The simplest way to expand a 3 by 3 matrix is to add these three to form the matrix and then add these three to form the matrix subtract these three to form the matrix and these three to form the matrix Multiply it by these three So there are six items in total, three positive and three negative Alright The first item There are three things, each of them has a lambda So this is a cubic expression in lambda The rest, the positive one, has no lambda On the other hand, the one that goes like this This is once in lambda This is also once in lambda The third one is also once in lambda So if you add up the six items in total The result is a cubic equation in lambda So the determinant of this equation is like this The first item is lambda cube Because if you multiply these three items together Each of them is minus lambda So the result is minus lambda cube Then multiply it by something to get lambda square Multiply it by something to get lambda Multiply it by something to get zero This method is like this In cubic equation, all the coefficients are real There must be a real solution How do you know? Because this thing on the left This is left hand side This is lambda This thing on the left is a function lambda When lambda goes to infinity These items are very small Only this item is big So it becomes negative infinity So the curve is like this When lambda equals negative infinity The first item becomes positive infinite So it is like this on this side Then it must go through the real axis For example, it can be like this It can also be It is easiest to go through once or three times Of course, it can also go through twice What is it like to go through twice? It is like this You can see it here So it can only go through once It can't go through twice Actually, it can go through three times It is a general case So it can go through at least once Okay, let's take that one It is called lambda 1 So lambda 1 is the solution of this equation So you get a J minus lambda 1 I I Determinant It is equal to 1 It is equal to 0 You have all studied linear algebra You know that When the determinant is equal to 0 It means that Its three columns Are linearly dependent It means that There exists a lambda There exists a phi Psi Psi is real Because lambda is real Everything is real There exists a real Such that it does not exist The meaning of this sentence When you read linear algebra It means that the three columns Of this matrix Are linearly dependent on each other This sentence is written like this But when you write it like this J psi is equal to Lambda 1 psi So this is called eigenvalue Lambda 1 is called eigenvalue Psi is called eigenvector So what this student is asking is How to get this eigenvalue How to get this eigenvector Answer You solve this equation The first step to solve this equation Is to get lambda Which is eigenvalue Second After you get the eigenvalue You use this equation To find the eigenvector In fact, in this case There must be three real eigenvalues When there are three real eigenvalues So there is Lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3 Corresponding to Psi 1, Psi 2, Psi 3 Is the main problem solved? There are other questions We will discuss later Is the main concept solved now? The definition of eigenvalue And the definition of eigenvector How to find Basically solved But there is a problem This eigenvalue In this case We have to prove All three eigenvalues Are real We just proved At least one eigenvalue Is real We have to prove All three eigenvalues are real Let me think how to prove This is because Its foundation is Because it is symmetrical A symmetrical Real matrix It must have three real eigenvalues How to prove A real symmetrical Matrix Must have Three real eigenvalues Is there anyone Can prove this? Let me try This J is real If it has a Proof If an eigenvalue Is complex Call it Lambda 2 Lambda 2 is complex So there is a Satisfied equation J Psi 2 Is equal to Lambda 2 Psi 2 So Psi 2 is real Sorry, Psi 2 is complex So J2 is also complex Is there anyone Can prove J is real J is symmetrical So I put Psi 2 Delta Delta is tilde star Star Is complex Tilde is horizontal So I put this here What is the result Psi 2 star J Psi 2 Is equal to Lambda 2 Psi 2 star Tilde Psi 2 What is this Psi 2 is a column Three elements Alpha, beta, gamma What is this Alpha absolute value squared Plus beta absolute value squared Plus gamma absolute value squared So this is a real positive number What is this This is because J is This is nine elements One in the middle is J And the opposite is a column Opposite is a row When you open it, there are nine elements In these nine elements The three diagonals Obviously are all real Because J's elements Are all real The diagonal elements Alpha square J11 Of course are all real All three are real The off-diagonal elements J is symmetry You immediately see that it is also real It is a number Plus its complex conjugate So it must be real So this must be real When you multiply this Lambda 2 is real So Actually We don't need the statement I just said Because it is three-dimensional So there is a real first It doesn't matter if it is three-dimensional or not It is a 4x4 MxM real symmetrical matrix All eigenvalues are real We can prove this With the proof just now Ok The student just asked How is the main diagonal How is the main diagonal We have already talked about it You have three real eigenvalues You have to solve for each real eigenvalue So there are three Now we are going to discuss An important problem It is called degeneracy Degeneracy In physics It didn't originate from here It originated from Quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics We found Some lines If you don't put a magnetic field It is one line If you put a little bit of magnetic field One line splits into two So we gradually know When there is no magnetic field It is not one line It is two lines It looks like one line But it is actually two lines In fact We will soon know it is degeneracy Not only because When the magnetic field is equal to zero They intersect And the intensity is added So we know There is only one line If there is no magnetic field There is only one line In fact, it is two lines When two things collide It is called degeneracy But physicists also have a meaning The physicists mean There are two kinds of three lambdas If all three lambdas are different It is called non-degenerate If all three lambdas are the same It is called There is one degeneracy If all three lambdas are the same It is totally degenerate So we are now discussing degeneracy First of all If all three lambdas are different Then we have Psi 1, Psi 2, Psi 3 This Psi 1, Psi 2, Psi 3 Can be solved We are now dividing them If two Psi 1, Psi 2, Psi 3 Are the same Then we get If Lambda 2 equals Lambda 3 Then we get J Psi 2 equals Lambda 2 Psi 2 J Psi 3 equals Lambda 2 Psi 3 J Psi 3 equals Lambda 2 Psi 3 There is a Psi 2 And a Psi 3 But Their Lambdas are the same In this situation, it is easy to prove that lambda2 plus lambda3 is also an eigenvector. Because you have lambda in front plus this in front plus this in front. If you mix these two, what is the coefficient of alpha? It also meets this.In other words, if psi2 and psi3 are of the same eigenvalue, it is a degenerate. If you mix these two, it is still an eigenvector. The physical meaning of this sentence is that there are three principal axes, psi1, psi2, and psi3.If the eigenvalue of psi2 and psi3 is degenerate, then you add them. If you add them, you get 45 degrees. If you add them, it is still an eigenvector.In fact, if you add psi1 and 1 over 2 of psi2, then you get 30 degrees. It is not exactly. It is a tangent.Anyway, if you add something, you can get as many degrees as you want. In other words, if it is a degenerate, its eigenvalue is not uniquely defined. Let me repeat.If the three eigenvalues are different, if you have one psi1, one psi2, and one psi3, then it is like this. If psi2 and psi3 are the same, then you choose this psi2 and psi3. It is fine.If you choose this, in other words, there is freedom in the choice. Freedom in the choice of psi2 and psi3. You can do whatever you want.You can have a linear combination of psi2 and psi3. So in that case, the diagonalization process is more free. You can choose one.If all three are the same, then you can choose any of the three linear combinations. So in that case, psi1, psi2, and psi3 are not well defined. You can choose psi1, psi2, and psi3.The freedom of choice of psi1, psi2, and psi3 and its relationship with the degeneracy of the eigenvalues are fully understood, right? Quantum mechanics is common practice. We do this all the time. Then I found another thing.The degeneracy is closely related to symmetry. For example, let's consider a cylinder. A normal cylinder has never been exercised.Its three eigenvalues are obvious. The eigenvectors are like this. One is like this.The other is like this. And these two eigenvectors and these two principal moment of inertia must be the same because they are symmetrical. In that case, psi1 is in this direction, and psi2 and psi3 can rotate freely.This is what we just said. In that case, it is obvious. Okay.If it is not like this, let's say it is a square column. A square column is obviously a principal axis. The other two principal axes are perpendicular to the other two principal axes.Because it is a square. If you cut it like this, it is obviously a principal axis. This is a principal axis.How do you know? If you think about it, the principal axis means the off-diagonal element must be equal to zero. If there is no off-diagonal element, it will have this point. If there is no off-diagonal element, it will have this point.So the off-diagonal contribution must be equal to zero. So it must be like this. And it must be the same.So in that case, what phenomenon do you find? Not only these two can rotate, but this can also rotate. It is the same no matter how you rotate it. So you find a very interesting phenomenon.What is it? In this case, it is a degenerate. In this case, it is also a degenerate. But this degenerate is due to symmetry.This degenerate is not due to symmetry. There is no rotation symmetry. There is no rotation symmetry, but it can also have degeneracy.So in other words, symmetry and degeneracy are deeply related. But it is like this. If there is symmetry, it will have degeneracy.This is the example. In this case, there is no symmetry, but it can also have degeneracy. So there is a phenomenon.If there is degeneracy, is there hidden symmetry? This problem cannot be discussed. Why? Because it is like this. Hidden symmetry and broken symmetry have become very important problems In other words, symmetry is getting more and more important in the second half of the 20th century.First of all, people understand the importance of symmetry. They understand the relationship between symmetry and degeneracy. Later, they understand that there is a relationship called subtlety.So there is a discussion about hidden symmetry and broken symmetry. These are still very important subjects in physics. What is the first concept that you came across? This is a very good example.In fact, you also did an experiment. If you want to shorten this thing, if you want to shorten high and low, all three eigenvalues can be symmetrical. In that situation, it has a lot of degeneracy, but there is no symmetry.So in that situation, it is an illustration. In some sense, you can call it a hidden symmetry. In short, what I have discussed in the past few minutes is to make you acquainted with the idea that there is a very important idea called degeneracy.Degeneracy is directly related to the experiment. But if you want to ask the reason for this degeneracy, sometimes the reason is symmetry, and sometimes it is hidden symmetry. I think I have answered all the questions Are you satisfied with the answers? If you are not satisfied, please raise your hand.Or do you have any other questions? If you don't have any other questions, I'm going to prove it now. There was no proof just now. If you want to write down the Bohr equation, f t t equals v squared f x x, I have to prove that the solution must be of the form b. Equation a implies equation b. I'm going to prove this now.To prove this, our original equation was y t t equals v squared y x x. Now I define alpha equals x plus v t, beta equals x minus v t. To solve this equation, x equals alpha plus beta over 2, v t equals alpha minus beta over 2. Any function x, y, x, t, is equal to y of alpha plus beta over 2, alpha minus beta over 2, v. So it is also a function. Of course. I just changed a variable.After changing the variable, I'm going to calculate d f d x. f x equals d f d x. Since f is a function of alpha and beta, I can take it as a function of alpha and beta. So sometimes I take f as a function of alpha and beta, and sometimes I take f as a function of x, y, x, t. When I take f as a function of x, t, I take f as a function of alpha and beta. You have to remember this.Remember. Sometimes I take f as a function of x, t. Sometimes I take f as a function of alpha, beta. But they are still the same function.Alright, so dF dx is equal to dF dx divided by dα dx plus dF dx divided by dβ dx This is the fundamental formula of Neutrality Differentiation When you are learning, there is only one variable Then there is only one If there are many variables, then there are two If there are three variables, then there are three Alright, so I calculate this This becomes dF dx dα dx dα dx is equal to dF dβ dα dx is equal to 1 dβ dx is also equal to 1 So it is equal to this Similarly, I want to calculate Ft Ft is equal to dF dt which is equal to dF dα dα dt plus dF dβ dβ dt But what is dα dt? It is V What is dβ dt? It is minus V So this is equal to V multiplied by dF dα minus dF dβ I can write this as Fα plus Fβ This is equal to V Fα minus Fβ I can write this as dα plus dβ multiplied by F This is equal to V dα minus V dβ Alright, I will write this in a simpler way dx of F is equal to dα plus dβ of F dt of F is equal to V dα minus V dβ

dβ of f But now I want to make it simpler. Forget about f. Because I will rewrite these two equations as follows. dx is equal to dα plus dβ.dt is equal to vdα minus vdβ. The meaning of these two equations is that these two equations have no function, only d. This is a abstract concept. Let's take the first equation on the left.What function does dx operate on? It is the same as this thing operates on the same function. In other words, this is a normal equation. This is an operator equation.You can write the operator as you like. You just have to operate on the same thing on the left and right. Does everyone understand this equation? OK, that's it.Because if you do this, I can connect the operators twice. I calculate it now. dt plus vdx is equal to 2βvdα.dt minus vdx is equal to 2βvβ. Again, the meaning of this equation is that if you operate on the same function on the left and right, the result will be correct, no matter what function it is. OK, now I have to operate twice.dt minus vdx. The meaning of this equation is that I can operate on any function on the left and right. I can operate on any function on the left and right.If I use these two functions, I can use these two functions twice. OK, now let's look at what is on the left. The one on the left is a good one.It is dtt minus v2dxx. This is what we want. The one on the right is equal to minus 4v2dβdα.OK, now let's operate on the right. Let's go back to the original equation. In the previous part, we said that after the derivation, there is an operator equation.You can operate on any function. If you operate on the right, the result will be that the left-hand side is equal to zero. Because the left-hand side is the wave equation.Therefore, dβdαy is equal to zero. Actually, I spent a lot of time on this. I just want to tell you that originally it was a differential equation of two functions.Now it has become a differential equation of one function. What does this sentence mean? I have a function y. This y is a function of x and t. Then we transform it into a function of α and β. How is it a function of α and β? First, you differentiate with respect to α. Then you differentiate with respect to β. It is equal to zero. OK.This means that dαy is independent of β. This is ddβ of this quantity. ddβ of this quantity is equal to zero. This means that this quantity is independent of β. So ddy is independent of β. Therefore, dαy is equal to f. Independent of β means that it is dependent on α. Therefore, it is equal to f. i.e. only dependent on α. OK.What does this function mean? This y is a function of α and β. After you differentiate with respect to α, it is only a function of α. This means that y is equal to integral fαdα. This is the difference. However, you can add any function of β. Because any function of β will be dropped out after you differentiate with respect to α. It will be dropped out.Therefore, this is equal to hαgβ. But what is α? α is x plus bt. Everybody happy? Think about it.In fact, we did nothing. We just did a trick. This trick requires you to be familiar with the differentiation as an operator.You can calculate it just like the ordinary multiplication. Then you can use this trick to prove the theorem. This kind of trick has many applications.This is just the simplest one. What do we prove? If y is a function of this, it means that y is a function of the direction of the wave. If it is true, it is a satisfied wave equation.We just proved that if it is a satisfied wave equation, it must be this way. Therefore, these two are equal. This is very amazing.If you can't do it, why can't you do it three times? Because it's a one-time thing. You can't do it three times. You can't do this trick.If you can do the trick three times, I think the world would be much easier. Unfortunately, or fortunately, the world is not like that. There is no easy solution.The equation to be done three times is ytt is equal to v square times the one-time space dimension. The wave equation can be completely solved. The three-dimensional wave equation is ytt is equal to v square times the proportion of y. What is the proportion of y? It is v square of yxx.The y is not good. It is ftt is equal to v square the proportion of f, which is v square fxx plus fyy plus fzz. There is only one replacement.This equation is fundamentally important. In fact, a lot of knowledge is solved in this equation. What kind of knowledge? For example, structural engineering, structural engineering, wireless communication, hydrodynamics, are basically equations like this.This kind of equation is very important in applied mathematics. I just said that if all these equations can be solved, then I think a lot of people will have no food to eat. There are a lot of engineers who are not easy to solve.So you have to study the nature of the solution or approximate the solution. If there is a solution, then the structure of the whole world is different. So you can say that there are a lot of social structures in the world as well as mechanical, electric, chemical structures, which are closely related to this equation.As I said the day before yesterday, I wrote down two equations. One is the continuity equation. The other is the pressure equation.The gradient of dp and dx are related to the rate of change of momentum. These two equations are very difficult to solve. But we made an approximation, a perturbation, which is a very small sound wave, an infinitesimal sound wave.In that case, we need to expand that technique, expand a complicated equation and use a perturbation for small vibrations. This is what we need to do all day in physics. After we expand that, we get two linear equations.When we combine these two linear equations, we get a wave equation. So we get sound velocity. Is there any question about the derivation? Is there any question about the derivation? I don't think so.No one asked a question just now. I think we can discuss other questions. Oh, about planetary motion.I don't think everyone has a question about planetary motion. Damped harmonic oscillator. Damped harmonic oscillator has a square root.If the square root is small, as we discussed last time, if the damped is too strong, the square root will become imaginary. If the square root becomes imaginary, it will not oscillate. There will be no oscillation at all.I don't think there is any discussion about that in the book. But I know that some students have learned about it in high school. OK, I will say it again.There are two kinds of exams. The topic in the exam has nothing to do with what we discussed just now. The topic in the exam I told you from the beginning.So you don't have to worry. However, if you learn something from the six items that I listed last time which are not contained in the book, then you have learned some of the spirit of more advanced physics. Another thing is this coming Sunday I will give another general talk.I thought about it. So what I am going to tell you this time is about my experience of studying and doing research. OK If you don't put forward the topic now, you can come one by one.Some people may hesitate to pose a public question. Then you can ask me in private. I will be here in the next 15 minutes.OK, bye bye. Bye bye. Some students wrote some questions.Professor Ruan and Professor An put them together. There are several questions. I will read the questions first.The first question is in the equation of wave function, how is the velocity V determined? Don't broadcast it. The proof in the book is not good. Our proof is that the equation is like this.In any equation like this, the equation of V is equal to the velocity. I will give you a proof now. I will give you a proof now.The solution of this equation I will prove it now. The solution is f of x minus vt plus g of x plus vt. What does this part mean? I talked about this part last time.If f is like this, then the next moment will be like this. So this part represents a wave going like this. No matter what shape the wave is, it goes like this.Similarly, this part represents a wave going like this. So the solution of this equation a is the sum of a wave going to the right plus a wave going to the left. I haven't proved it yet.I just told you what it means. To prove this, we need to divide it into two parts. First, I need to prove that this y is equal to this equation.The first part is that this equation whatever f and g are, are equal to this. It's easy. Just try it.y prime yx dy dx is equal to f prime of x minus vt plus g prime of x plus vt. What is yxx? What is x? It's equal to this. Plus g double prime of this.What is yt? It's positive over to t. It's equal to v times f prime x minus vt plus vt times v times g prime of x plus vt. What is yx? It's equal to v squared f prime of x minus vt plus v squared times g double prime of x plus vt. So, ytt is equal to v squared yxx.Just a second. There is a negative sign. Now it's correct.This is straightforward differentiation. This so far has only proved half of it. Second, to prove that any solution of A is of the form the first step is to prove that B corresponds to A and the second step is to prove that any solution of A is of the form B. To prove this, we have talked about a problem in the book.It's a string which however consists of two parts, L1 and L2 with velocities v1 and v2. Let's review that. The final equation is like this.Now, L1 divided by v1. L1 is the length, the first part of the length. v1 is the velocity in that part.So that is the time. T1 is the time required by the sound wave or by the string wave to move from one end of L1 to the other end. Similarly, L2 over v2 is equal to T2.So, our equation is cotangent omega T1 is equal to minus v1 over v2 cotangent of omega T2. We can invert this equation. It becomes tangent of omega T1 is equal to minus v2 over v1 tangent of omega T2.Now, these are very complicated. They are the same equations. These are complicated equations in general.So therefore, if you have a string like this, you get very complicated harmonics. The different omegas are in general rather complicated. But let us take a special case that T1 is equal to T2.Because you can choose the length L1 and L2. And you can also choose the string material. So you can choose v1 and v2.And therefore, it is perfectly possible to make T1 equal to T2. In other words, although the velocities in the two regions are not the same, but you can make lengths such that they just match the ratio of the velocities. If you do that, the equation becomes these two become the same.So we get 1 plus v1 over v2 cotangent of omega T1 is equal to 0. What that means, because this is a positive quantity, so this has to be so cotangent of omega T1 has to be equal to 0. Cotangent of omega T1 is equal to 0. That means omega T1 is equal to pi over 2. Or pi over 2 plus pi. Pi over 2 plus 2 pi. Etc.So pi over 2 plus is equal to pi over 2. That means that pi over 2 means that when it goes to the joint point is 90 degrees. And this part is like this. Those parts are sine waves.90 degrees of sine waves. But because the velocities are not the same, so therefore it's like this. The next one is one and a half.Therefore it looks like this. It's three quarters of a wave on each side. Etc.But you can also have the solution of this. The other possibility is 1 plus V2 over V1 times tangent of omega T1 is equal to 0. So tangent of omega T1 is equal to 0. In other words, this is a possibility. This is a possibility.Actually, what this means is when tangent of omega T1 is equal to 0, it means cotangent is equal to infinity. So this equation is also correct. Infinity is equal to minus infinity.You know infinity is equal to minus infinity because the universe of it are both equal to plus 0 or minus 0. If you take this, then you know omega T1 is equal to pi, 2 pi, 3 pi. So if you plot it, it's like this.

It reaches pi. Or, if it's 2pi, then it's... Just to make sure that we have not done anything wrong, let us now take the special case that not only t1 is equal to t2, but v1 is equal to v2. In other words, it's one string, but somehow you say that I now divide into two parts.If you look at that, then you will see that all these solutions are, in fact, correct. Okay, now we go to chapter 19, about heat and temperature. The theory of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are great achievements of 19th century physics.In fact, the greatest achievement of 19th century physics were this area, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and electricity and magnetism. First, the concept of temperature, of course, is something that is in daily life. Every child knows that there is a concept of temperature, and that if you have two things which are in contact, then the hotter one is going to become cooler, and the cooler one is going to become hotter, so that eventually they become the same temperature.So this concept is generally well-known among all civilizations. The question is, can we measure it? I do not know at what time in Chinese history people have invented somewhat accurate measurements of temperature, but in the West, in Europe, temperature measurements have already been in existence for hundreds of years. And you all know that there is a freezing point of water, and that is usually taken as 0 degree centigrade, and the boiling point of water, if you want to be more precise, boiling point of water at one atmosphere pressure, it is taken to be 100 degree centigrade.Then people devised various thermometers. One of the earliest accurate kind was mercury thermometer. Mercury thermometer I am sure all of you have seen, because mercury expands when the temperature increases, so you can make a column of mercury.And at zero temperature you draw a mark, 0 degree centigrade. At 100 degrees you draw another mark, 100 degrees. And then you make uniform divisions between the marks, so that is a thermometer.And that indeed is what everybody uses. But of course if somebody else makes a different thermometer, for example you can make an alcohol thermometer, you can in fact make a water thermometer, except that that doesn't work very well. You can use all kinds of thermometers.Then there is a question of do these measurements agree with each other? By definition, of course, if you calibrate it such that the 0 degrees, you define it to be the same, 100 degrees you define it to be the same, then how about 50 degrees? Now if you look at it, you will find that for most thermometers in use, they are about the same, but not exactly. And the great achievement of thermodynamics in the 19th century was to find that in fact there is a way to define an absolute temperature. That absolute temperature is neither the one measured by a mercury thermometer nor the one measured by an alcohol thermometer, but is otherwise defined, and that's called absolute temperature.So there is the concept of absolute temperature, which is what in the next few chapters we are going to go through. It's a very subtle concept. Eventually, with the absolute temperature, we find that there is an absolute zero of temperature.That absolute zero of temperature with the mercury scale becomes minus 373. The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature, and the Kelvin scale has an absolute zero. No, it's zero K. It's equal to minus 370 degrees centigrade.And the three... 200. Minus 273 degrees centigrade. It is also calibrated to such that it's 270 degrees and is calibrated such that 300 boiling point, 373 degree K is equal to 100 degrees centigrade.So in the Kelvin scale, between boiling point and the freezing point of water at one atmosphere is still 100 K difference. We will come back to the absolute temperature later on. We all know that most things expand when heated, and so there is a coefficient of expansion.And the length, this alpha is called the coefficient of linear expansion. Why do we write it this way? Why do we divide by L? I already mentioned that. This is an intensive quantity.Delta L over L is an intensive quantity. That means if you compute delta L over L for the whole rod, it's the same as if you cut it into two and just take half that length, because delta L is halved and L is also halved. So delta L over L is an intensive quantity.And so this is an intensive quantity. It does not depend on how long the rod is. Similarly, there's a coefficient of volume expansion, and the book says that beta is equal to 3 alpha.Does anybody know why beta is equal to 3 alpha? Okay, you tell us why. Right. I'll put it another way.Actually, beta is not equal to 3 alpha. Beta is equal to 1 plus alpha cubed, which is equal to 1 plus beta. Alpha is very small, because each side has an alpha.So for a volume, each side has an alpha plus 1, so the three sides are 1 plus alpha cubed. But this 1 plus alpha cubed, if you expand it, it becomes 1 plus 3 alpha plus 3 times alpha squared plus alpha cubed. But these two are small, because alpha is a very small quantity.So if you forget about it, then you know that beta is equal to 3 alpha. You should take a look at the book. There's a table that tells you about the thermal expansion of all kinds of things.We are going to learn about the kinetic theory of gases. We're going to learn that everything is made of atoms. So do we have a theory, a fundamental theory consisting of a theory of atoms? Do we understand why it expands? The answer is yes.We have not a theory from the beginning, but we understand why things expand. That has something to do with the molecular interaction between atoms. What happens is that in any material, let's say in a crystal, all the atoms occupy lattice positions, but they vibrate.And as the temperature increases, they vibrate more. And when they vibrate more, they need more room, so therefore it expands. It's a little bit like if you have many people in a room jammed up, and if everybody begins to move, it's clear that you need more room for the whole crowd.So it's exactly the same idea. But one can then make approximate calculations of thermal expansion coefficients. It's difficult to make exact calculations, but the general ideas can be well understood.These sections you should all read. It has a lot of very interesting material, not easily written down as a formula. So you should read.When I wrote syllabus, read certain chapter. That means you should read it. Everybody knows that, as I said earlier, if you have a high-temperature thing in contact with a low-temperature thing, the high-temperature thing is going to become cooler.The low-temperature thing is going to become warmer. So it's very obvious that perhaps something flew from one body to the other one, and that something is called heat, and that heat flow can be measured. It turns out that the heat is an energy, and therefore it's measured.The unit of heat is equal to calorie, and one calorie is equal to 4.1860 joule. A joule is a rather small quantity. A calorie, one calorie is also not large.Approximately when you heat one gram of water, one gram of water is just... I think this pan would have probably three grams of... If this pan were filled with water, it would be about three grams. And if you raise that to one degree, it would need three calories. So if you have a cup of water, if you raise it from zero degrees to 100 degrees, a cup of water may have, let's say, 200 grams.So that would be 20,000 calories to raise that cup of water by 100 degrees approximately. So you see that a calorie is not a very large unit. Heat capacity.We introduced the concept of a specific heat. 比重,比热 So if you want to heat something by delta T degrees, you need this amount of heat. The way we write it is as if raising something by one degree always requires the same amount of heat.Actually, this quantity, C, specific heat, is dependent on the temperature. But for most substances, in the usual case, the variation of C with temperature is very little. For example, if you want to heat water from zero degrees to 100 degrees, from zero to 50 degrees, the amount of heat required is almost the same as from 50 degrees to 100 degrees.But if you want to be exact, then it's not the same. So C is approximately constant for water between zero and 100 degrees, but not exactly. And the book gives you a table of it.For water, C is equal to one calorie per degree per gram. Now, there is a more subtle concept. When we say water, in raising it one degree, needs that one calorie, what we mean is that we do it at a constant pressure.But since water also expands as you heat it up, so there is a different concept called constant volume specific heat. What we usually talk about is constant pressure specific heat. There is also the concept of constant volume specific heat.In the case of water, these two are very, very different. Because if you keep the volume of the water and not allow it to expand, then it's a very different story. So this is usually not used.Rarely used for liquid and solids. For liquids and solids, usually you talk about the constant pressure specific heat. But for gas, both of them are used.And these two concepts are different, and we are going to deal with that in great detail later. There is another concept called heat of transformation. There is the concept of phase transition, and we are very familiar with the phase transition of water in freezing or melting and in boiling.Now, in each such transformations, without changing the temperature, just to change the phase requires a certain heat, either going into the material or coming out of the material. So there is a heat of evaporation. Heat of evaporation means you take water at 100 degrees.To change that into vapor at 100 degrees requires a certain amount of energy. So that's heat of water. Heat of evaporation, also called heat of boiling, is equal to... All this you can read from the table in the book.It's kilojoules per kilogram. There's also heat of melting or heat of freezing. It's 333 kilojoules per kilogram.Now we introduce the concept of a PV diagram. Notice that this is not an intensive, intensive diagram, because P is intensive, but V is extensive. Pressure is intensive.That means at the same temperature, at the same pressure, no matter how much of a gas you take, it has the same pressure, the same temperature. So pressure and temperature are intensive quantities, but volume is extensive. Volume depends on how much of the material you take.This diagram is very commonly used for gases. It's an intensive-extensive diagram. Now I'm sure that you all know about the ideal gas law, which we are going to deal with extensively soon.So for a constant temperature, T times V is a constant, so you get a curve. Does anybody know what is the mathematical name for such a curve? PV is equal to a constant. What is the name of this curve? It's a hyperbola.XY is equal to 1, for example. This curve is like this. This curve has two branches.Normally, when you draw a line, you turn it 45 degrees like this, and then there are two branches. XY is equal to 1, and there are two branches. Because here, XY is here.X has changed its sign, Y has changed its sign, so it's also satisfied. But of course, when you talk about PV equal to a constant, you only take this branch. This is one of the most common kind of hyperbola.For different temperatures, if you have a lower temperature, you get a... so you get different hyperbolas. Now, suppose I fix a temperature and start from this point. That means I have a volume of gas and put it at that pressure at that volume.Now I let it expand isothermally. Isothermally means... so it will follow this curve, and the volume is increasing. Because in order to expand, it has to... it has to press the... if it has a piston, it has to press the piston.If it has a piston, it has to push the piston outward. So it is doing work on the outside. It is doing work on the piston.So what is work? Obviously, work is equal to integral PV. This area. Why is it integral PV? Because... suppose this distance is... area is A. Push the distance is L. Then what about its pressure? Pressure times A is equal to force.Force times distance. So it is A, P, D, L. It is equal to work done on the piston by the gas. But of course, it is equal to A, D, P, L. It is equal to P, D, A, L. Which is equal to P, D, V. Is that clear? It is trivial.So the work is integral PV. Integral PV is just an area.
