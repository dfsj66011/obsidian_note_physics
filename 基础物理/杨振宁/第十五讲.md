 We had talked about the gyroscope. If it has an angular momentum of L, this is the z-axis.It's at the angle of theta. There were several, I said, well we had analyzed how it moves. The question was it can precess around the z-axis.It's at the top which precesses around the z-axis. The motion which goes around this way is called nutation. Nutation means that it's not stable.（我们之前讨论过陀螺仪。如果它的角动量为L，这是z轴。它与z轴的夹角为θ。我们分析过它的运动方式。问题是它能绕z轴进动。位于顶部的陀螺会绕z轴进动。这种绕轴旋转的运动称为章动。章动意味着它不稳定。）

It's not a smooth operation. It goes around that circle. Like in the diagram that I showed you of Feynman, in Feynman's book.Several students came to me and said that there is a motion which is smoothly just going around without the nutation. I didn't believe that. But I went back and went through a complicated analysis.They were right. It's possible to have that motion. And the final formula is like this.mg is the weight of this body. This rod is supposed to be weightless. The length of the rod is supposed to be L. （这并不是一个平稳的运动。它会绕着那个圆圈转。就像我在费曼的书中给你们看的费曼图那样。有几个学生来找我，说有一种运动可以平稳地绕圈而不产生章动。我一开始并不相信。但后来我回去进行了复杂的分析。他们是对的。确实存在这种运动。最终的公式是这样的。mg代表这个物体的重量。这根杆子假设是无重的。杆子的长度假设为L。）


Theta is this angle.Theta can be 90 degrees but it can be bigger or smaller than 90 degrees. Capital omega is the angular velocity around the z-axis if it goes smoothly. I2, this top, this gyroscope has a I1 which is the main one.But it has three angular momenta. It has three principal axes of inertia. And one of them is I1.The other two are I2 and I3 which are supposed to be the same. Then it can have this formula. If cosine theta is zero, then theta is 90 degrees.（θ代表这个角度。θ可以是90度，也可以大于或小于90度。大写的Ω表示绕z轴的角速度，前提是运动平稳。I2，这个顶部，这个陀螺仪有一个主要的I1。但它有三个角动量，有三个主惯性轴。其中一个是I1，另外两个是I2和I3，它们应该是相同的。这样就能得到这个公式。如果cosθ为零，那么θ就是90度。）


This becomes exactly the formula that I had derived in class. But at that time I thought that that's only an approximation. For theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation.Even for theta equal to zero, I thought it's an approximation. But after careful analysis, it's not an approximation. For theta equal to zero, it was exact.Next, we discuss on a rigid body. If there is a complicated rigid body, it has a center of mass. Now every part of the body is attracted by gravity.Actually, this is the real situation. （这正是我在课堂上推导出的公式。但当时我以为那只是个近似值。对于θ等于零的情况，我也以为是个近似值。即使θ等于零，我仍认为是个近似值。但经过仔细分析后，发现它并非近似值。当θ等于零时，这个公式是完全精确的。接下来我们讨论刚体问题。如果一个复杂的刚体存在质心，那么物体的每一部分都会受到重力作用。实际上，这才是真实情况。）


Every part of the body is subject to gravity depending on the density. If there is a particularly heavy part of that body, then the gravity here is higher.We now want to prove a theorem that the total effect of all these gravitational forces on different parts of the body is equivalent to one force acting only on one point, the center of mass, and with a magnitude proportional to the total mass of the body. So let me, theorem. The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude sum of mg on the center of mass.（身体的每一部分都根据其密度受到重力影响。如果身体某个部位特别重，那么该处的重力就更大。我们现在要证明一个定理：所有这些重力对身体不同部位的作用效果，等同于一个仅作用于质心的单一力，其大小与身体总质量成正比。那么我来陈述定理：重力对刚体的总作用效果，等同于一个大小为mg总和、作用于质心的单一力。）


The total effect on a rigid body by gravity is equivalent to that of a single force with magnitude sum of mg on the center of mass. This is true for a static situation. The results of the Qilong test were very good.and perhaps talk to Professor Rang or Professor An about how you could do better later on this semester. It's clear that the average score of Tsinghua students is much better than my students at Stony Brook. So I'm pleased about that.Today's first topic is gravity inside Earth. We talked about the shell theorem last time. That is, if you consider the gravity due to this shell at a point inside the Earth, there is no force on it.（重力对刚体的总效应等同于一个大小为mg的合力作用于质心。这在静态情况下成立。启龙测试的结果非常好。或许你可以和冉教授或安教授谈谈这学期后期如何做得更好。显然，清华大学学生的平均成绩比我石溪分校的学生要好得多。对此我感到很高兴。今天的第一个主题是地球内部的重力。我们上次讨论了壳层定理。也就是说，如果你考虑地球内部某一点由这个壳层产生的重力，那么该点不受力。）

Now for the next shell, there's also no force. So that means all the material in the Earth outside of this circle together have no gravity on this point. The gravity on that point is due to all the material inside of that radius.So this gravity at all equal to gravity due to the material inside the sphere of radius R. Now, that material has a mass of is equal to 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. Well, we are assuming a uniform sphere. This is not true, but let us assume it's a uniform sphere.The volume of the sphere is 4 pi over 3 times R cubed. If rho is the density, then that material has a mass of this amount. （现在来看下一个壳层，同样没有力。这意味着地球在这个圆圈之外的所有物质对这个点都没有引力作用。该点的引力完全来自于该半径以内的所有物质。因此，这个引力等于半径为R的球体内物质产生的引力。现在，假设这是一个均匀球体（虽然实际情况并非如此），该球体的体积为4π/3乘以R的立方。如果ρ表示密度，那么这部分物质的质量就等于这个体积乘以密度。）


By the shell theorem, our external points, the gravitational force at O is equal to all that mass being concentrated at the center.So it's equal to minus g times m. So m is the mass at this point times this density, this mass, divided by R cubed, divided by R squared. This is g m, capital M, divided by R squared. And that is, of course, equal to something, something, something times R. A constant times R. So we now have the conclusion.Inside the Earth, the gravitational force is proportional to R. （根据壳层定理，对于外部点O而言，引力等效于所有质量集中于中心点所产生的效果。因此引力等于负g乘以m。这里的m是该点的质量乘以密度（即此处的质量），再除以R的立方，然后除以R的平方。这相当于g乘以大写的M（总质量）除以R的平方。显然，这个结果等于某个常数乘以R。于是我们得出重要结论：在地球内部，引力大小与距离R成正比。）


It's equal to zero at the center, obviously, because at the center it's spherically symmetrical. There's no force in any direction. But as you go away from it, the attractive force becomes larger and larger, proportional to R, until you reach this point.关于这一点有没有问题? Now we talk about Section 10-6, Gravitational Potential Energy. 引力的未能,potential energy是未能。 We want to prove that the potential energy is equal to minus g m m. 大m是,小m是,大m是sun,小m是earth. 我们先take one dimension.（在中心处显然等于零，因为在中心处是球对称的。任何方向都没有力。但随着你远离中心，吸引力会越来越大，与R成正比，直到你到达这一点。关于这一点有没有问题？现在我们讨论第10-6节，引力势能。引力的未能，potential energy是未能。我们要证明势能等于负g m m。大M是太阳，小m是地球。我们先取一维情况。）


假如u是这样子的话, 我们从前说这个force是等于 minus du dr. 我们从前说这个,就是 just a second. This is equal to g m m r squared.Let's see, something's wrong. First, there's a minus here, here, there's a minus sign here, and d dr, d dr, get the minus sign. So this is right.所以,假如你u可以这样子的话, 这个force是等于这个,correct. 所以,u等于这是correct. 这是一个one-dimensional problem.How about the three-dimensional? Three-dimensional的话,要用所谓partial differentiation. Three-dimensional的时候, 然后,这个u是等于minus g m m r, 现在是x squared加y squared加z squared. 现在是three-dimensional了。 （如果U是这样的，我们之前说过这个力等于负的dU/dr。我们之前说过这个，就是——稍等。这等于G M m / r²。让我看看，好像有点问题。首先这里有个负号，这里，这里有个负号，然后d/dr，d/dr，得到这个负号。所以这是对的。所以，如果你的U可以是这样，这个力就等于这个，正确。所以U等于这个是正确的。这是一个一维问题。三维情况呢？三维的话要用所谓的偏微分。在三维情况下，这个U等于负的G M m / r，现在r是x² + y² + z²。现在是三维了。）


那么,对于x,y,z,你要differentiate的时候, 叫做partial differentiation, that means, when you differentiate relative to x, you consider y and z as fixed.When you differentiate with respect to y, you consider x and z as fixed. So, this notation叫做force,是一个vector, 是du dx,minus du dx, minus du dy, minus du dz. 这个notation是叫partial differentiation.这里有一个平常的这个叫做gradient, 三角形加一个箭头的意思, 就是三个partial differentiation, partial x, partial y, partial z. OK,我们来试一下。 假如我们take这个的话, 那么,du dx是等于minus g m m, 乘上du d这个square root, 然后,d这个square root,dx。 （那么，对于x、y、z进行微分时，就叫做偏微分。也就是说，当你对x微分时，要把y和z视为常数；当你对y微分时，要把x和z视为常数。这个记号叫做力，是一个矢量，即du/dx、-du/dx、-du/dy、-du/dz。这个记号称为偏微分。这里有个常用的符号叫梯度，用倒三角形加箭头表示，就是三个偏微分：∂/∂x、∂/∂y、∂/∂z。好，我们来试一下。如果我们取这个的话，那么du/dx等于负g乘以m乘以m，再乘以du/d这个平方根，然后d这个平方根/dx。）


这就是所谓chain rule, 你在differentiate的时候, 这是minus g m m, 那du d这个东西呢, 这u是1 over r, du d 1 over r, 这个minus 1 over r squared, 所以这个是minus 1 over, d这个square root,dx呢, 是等于二分之一的square root, 二分之一,1 over square root, 乘上d这个square root, d这个square root的inside, 就是x squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 因为这是中间的东西的二分之一, 所以dsquare root of一个something, 是等于二分之一的1 over square root of that thing, 乘上d它里头的,所以就变成这个。 对不起。 这还要乘上dx squared,加y squared,加z squared,dx。 这个算了一顿以后, 就得出来g m m r squared, 乘上x over r。 （这就是所谓的链式法则。当你进行微分时，这里是负的g m m。那么du d这个东西呢，u等于1除以r，du d(1/r)就是负的1除以r的平方，所以这里是负的1除以... d这个平方根，dx等于二分之一乘以平方根，也就是二分之一乘以1除以平方根，再乘以d这个平方根内部的内容，即x平方加y平方加z平方，关于dx的微分。因为这是中间步骤的二分之一，所以d(某物的平方根)等于二分之一乘以1除以该物的平方根，再乘以d该物内部的微分，于是就得到了这个结果。抱歉，这里还需要乘以dx平方加y平方加z平方关于dx的微分。经过这一系列计算后，最终得到g m m除以r平方，乘以x除以r。）


所以你这样算出来这个f, 就等于g m m over r squared, 有个负号,因为这有个负号, 乘上x over r,同样y over r,z over r, 它是三个component。 这个间线呢,就变成minus g m m over r squared, 乘上r over r。 这是什么意思呢? 这个是the force, r over r是unit vector along the r direction, 所以比如说是, 这空间有一点, 这个unit vector是r over r, 因为r over r当然是在r direction, 它的magnitude是1, 所以这是unit vector。 那所以这个force是对的。 Correct. In other words, we have proven that u是等于这个。 在three dimension的时候,u也是对的。 这个formula可以记得。（所以你这样算出来这个力f，就等于g m m除以r的平方，有个负号（因为这里有个负号），乘以x除以r，同理y除以r，z除以r，这是它的三个分量。这个中间步骤呢，就变成了负的g m m除以r的平方，乘以r向量除以r。这是什么意思呢？这个力，r向量除以r是沿r方向的单位向量。比如说，空间中有个点，这个单位向量就是r向量除以r，因为r向量除以r自然是在r方向上，其模长为1，所以是单位向量。因此这个力是正确的。没错。换句话说，我们已经证明了u等于这个。在三维情况下，u也是正确的。这个公式可以记下来。）

所以这个force是可以写成这样。 Conservation of energy. 我们现在有这个formula, F是等于minus gradient of u, gradient的意思就是d dx,d dy,d dz, 可是我们知道这东西是等于m乘上r double dot, 这是Newton's law, 所以我把它用r dot, dot一下子, 我把它写成minus r dot, dot, 右边这是什么? 右边就等于d dt, of 1 over 2, m, r dot, dot r dot, 你同意不同意? Because if I differentiate this, I can differentiate this one first. Plus, I differentiate this one. Those terms would give you r dot dot r double dot. So that two cancels this two, so this is this.（所以这个力可以这样表示。能量守恒。我们现在有这个公式，F等于负的u的梯度，梯度的意思就是d/dx, d/dy, d/dz，但是我们知道这个东西等于m乘以r的二阶导数，这是牛顿定律，所以我用r的一阶导数来表示它，一下子写成负的r的二阶导数，右边是什么？右边等于d/dt，1/2乘以m，r的一阶导数点乘r的一阶导数，你同意吗？因为如果我对此求导，我可以先对这个求导。再加上，我对这个求导。这些项会给你r的一阶导数点乘r的二阶导数。所以这两个抵消了这两个，所以这个就是这个。）

And this is d dt of m v squared. That's our old friend, the kinetic energy. But what is the left side? The left side is minus d dr dt dot d dx plus.I write this explicitly, right? This is equal to minus x dot times du dx minus y dot du dy minus z dot du dz. Do you agree or disagree? Because that's what's meant by the dot product. Dot product means you write these three components down.X dot, y dot, z dot. The gradient is d dx, d dy, d dz. But once you have du dx, dx, dx, dt, du dy, dy, dy, this means minus du dt.（这是关于m v平方的d dt。那是我们的老朋友，动能。但左边是什么呢？左边是负的d dr dt点d dx加上。我写得明确些，对吧？这等于负的x点乘以du dx减去y点du dy减去z点du dz。你同意还是不同意？因为这就是点积的含义。点积意味着你把这三个分量写下来：x点、y点、z点。梯度是d dx、d dy、d dz。但一旦你有du dx、dx、dx、dt、du dy、dy、dy，这意味着负的du dt。）


So we have, so putting these two together, we get d dt of u plus kinetic energy. So u plus one half m v squared is equal to a constant. And that's usually called E total energy.This is, of course, something that we are familiar with. We have been familiar with already about the total conservation of energy. Now the only thing that's new is for the gravitational force.We know explicitly what the conservation, what the energy expression is. Is this U is a minus GMM divide by R. Any questions? （因此，将这两部分结合起来，我们得到d/dt(u + 动能)。即u + (1/2)mv²等于一个常数，这个常数通常被称为总能量E。当然，这是我们熟悉的概念，我们已经了解了能量守恒定律。现在唯一的新内容是针对引力的情况。我们明确知道守恒定律以及能量表达式的具体形式，即这里的U等于-GMM除以R。有什么问题吗？）


I'm going to talk about the escape velocity, neglect air resistance. So if on Earth, you put a rocket with velocity v, of course the rocket has to overcome the resistance of air.But let us neglect that. Let us assume that the satellite or the rocket is already above the Earth's atmosphere. Let's say above 50 kilometers, there is essentially no more atmosphere.Does anybody know how the atmosphere goes down when you go farther and farther away? I'm sure you know that as you go farther and farther away from the Earth, the air pressure becomes less and less.（我将要讨论逃逸速度，忽略空气阻力。所以如果在地球上，你以速度v发射一枚火箭，当然火箭必须克服空气的阻力。但让我们忽略这一点。让我们假设卫星或火箭已经在地球大气层之外。比如说在50公里以上，基本上就没有大气了。有人知道当你离地球越来越远时，大气是如何逐渐减少的吗？我相信你们都知道，随着你离地球越来越远，气压会变得越来越低。）


And it's a complicated phenomenon because there is also temperature. There is a temperature variation, but roughly when you go out, you know that the pressure decreases, essentially exponentially.It's about every five kilometers, the pressure becomes half. So if you go very far, there's no more air pressure. So now let us start from that point.If I shoot the rocket at that point out, if it's too slow, it will come down. It will be pulled down by Earth. The question is at what velocity would it escape?（这是一个复杂的现象，因为还涉及温度因素。温度会有所变化，但大致来说，当你向外太空行进时，气压会呈指数级下降——大约每上升五公里，气压就会减半。如果飞行距离足够远，气压最终会完全消失。现在让我们从这个临界点开始思考：如果我在这个临界点发射火箭，当速度不足时，火箭仍会被地球引力拉回。那么问题来了：究竟需要多大的初速度才能实现逃逸？）


Well, if it escapes, that means that because of the conservation of energy, that means that when it reaches infinity, it essentially has no more velocity.So if it escapes, then E equal to minus G M M over R plus one-half M V squared must be greater than zero. Because... Because at R equal to infinity, E... If it can escape, that means that when... There is no square. When it reaches infinity, potential energy is zero.Kinetic energy is positive. Kinetic energy is always positive, so the total energy has to be positive. But at zero, it just barely escapes.That means that if E is equal to zero, that means it will go out, and by the time it reaches infinity, it has slowed down to V equal to zero. So that velocity is the escape velocity. So E equal to zero gives escape velocity.And that, of course, is equal to 2 M 2 G M M. Yeah. In this case, M, that is the mass of Earth. Yeah, but the number of kilometers per second for Earth.And this number, if you estimate, is about a hundred times the speed of a car, of an ordinary car. But of course, if you send a rocket from the Earth, you must first have enough thrust to make it escape from the atmosphere. And then you have to have this speed before it can go out of the Earth's attraction.There's an R here, sorry. One of the most important events in the history of mankind is the understanding of planetary orbits by Newton. In China, the ancient philosophers did not have, from today's viewpoint, the correct view about the structure of the universe.The Greeks also had an incorrect view, but their way of thinking about it eventually led to Newton's discovery. First, in the Greek times, the most important person was Ptolemy. He lived in Greece from 90 to 168 AD.The way that he was thinking, and in fact the way all the Greeks were thinking, was that the Earth is at the center of the universe. And furthermore, they had the following feeling. They wanted to construct a universe which is most beautiful.Because they believed God must create a most perfect, most beautiful structure. And what is most beautiful? The circle is most beautiful. So they called it the harmony of circles.They thought that the Earth is at the center of the universe, and the stars, the planets, would all go around in circles. But that's not correct. By observation, they knew that, for example, the motion of Mars is very complicated.So they thought it's not a circle. The next complicated but beautiful thing is a circle on a circle. What is a circle on a circle? If you have a ball here, and a circle, while the center is moving in a big circle, there's a particle which goes around this, so you would get something like this.That's called circle on circle. And they tried to adjust the sizes of these two circles to make it match the motion of the planets. It didn't work.So they make it a circle on a circle on a circle. And since there are many planets, so there are many circles, and at one point, somebody had the complete structure of the planets' motion. There were 80 some circles.And that was the general way of thinking about planetary motion. Now why are planetary motions so very important? Because there's agriculture. When you develop agriculture, you know that agriculture depends on the understanding of the seasons.And understanding of the seasons depends on understanding of the motion of the stars around the Earth as you see them. So that astronomy is an important subject in every civilization. It's an obvious thing.Because if you develop agriculture, then astronomy becomes important. But there are regularities of the motion of the stars, of the planets. But there are also strange motions.So people began to try to puzzle out these strange motions. And therefore, this circle on circle on circle kind of idea. That held back Western astronomy for more than 2,000 years, until Copernicus.He advocated heliocenter theory. You all know that Galileo subscribed to this theory. Galileo believed in this theory and was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Nevertheless, many astronomers began to think about the heliocenter theory. The next important development was Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe was an observer.He made accurate measurements of the position of various planets year after year. And after he died, his data was analyzed by Kepler. So Brahe was an experimental astronomer.Kepler was a theoretical astronomer. It was very interesting how Kepler made his great discoveries. He concentrated on the motion of Mars.And the motion of Mars, according to Copernicus' idea, was mostly a circle. In fact, the orbit of Mars as we know it today is almost a circle. But because Brahe's data was very accurate, so Kepler was able to accurately map the position of Mars and found that it's not a circle.It doesn't fit a circle. It almost fits a circle, but not quite. And then one day he suddenly realized it's not a circle at all.It's an ellipse. This is one of the most important events in the history of mankind. The reason that he could land on the idea of an ellipse is also because the Greeks had studied ellipses in detail.We all know, and I'm sure you have learned, plane geometry, Euclid's geometry in high schools. But the Greeks developed geometry much more than Euclid. After Euclid, they studied what is called a conic section.A conic section is you take a cone, take a circular cone, and you can cut it. If you cut it this way, obviously it's a circle. If you cut it this way, it's an ellipse.So this way you get a circle. This way you get an ellipse. If you cut it this way, then it has two branches.One cut in the top, one cut in the bottom. You get a hyperbola. Circle is a circle.

Ellipse is a cone. Hyperbola is called a conic section. All of these curves, their relationship to each other, and their relationship to the cone, were studied in great detail.Beautiful work in Greek times after Euclid. And Kepler, being a theorist, knew these conic section results very well. That is perhaps the reason why it dawned on him one day that the reason that one cannot fit a circular orbit to the trajectory of Mars was because it's not a circle, it is an ellipse.And once that's done, he formulated the three laws. These laws, in today's language, are called empirical laws. Empirical means experimental.The first law is that planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. An ellipse always has two focuses. An ellipse has something called ellipticity.I think ellipticity is called ellipticity, right? Ellipticity. When this ellipticity is zero, it is a circle. When it is one, it is a parabola.When it is greater than one, it is a hyperbola. We'll come to this later. So the first law says that all planetary orbits are ellipses.And that was very accurately correct for a long time. Then, of course, when people had more accurate measurements, they found slight corrections to this. And that correction needed additional considerations.And that's outside of our discussion this semester. The second law says that a planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. This is what it means.When a planet is moving, for example, in one unit time, it has a small triangle. In another unit time, these triangles are in the same area. As it goes around.A planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. The way that he formulated this law shows that he was a very geometrical person. He evidently plotted the curves and observed that when the planet moves slower, that when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower.But this distance is longer, and this area becomes the same. So, when it comes to here, it moves very fast. But in the unit time, it still sweeps the same area.The third law says the period, cube, divided by... T is the period around the sun. A is the semi-major axis. From this point to this point, that distance is called 2A.Different satellites all around the same sun share the same value of T cubed divided by... T squared divided by A cubed. Sorry, T squared. Kepler died in the year 1630.A few years later, Newton was born. Newton explained. Newton was both an experimentalist and a theorist.He was a great experimentalist as well as a theorist. But perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind was his discovery of calculus, of the origin of the planetary motion,

The most important contribution of Newton was he explained the three laws, Kepler's three laws, through the theory of gravitation. These three laws are explained in the book, but it was too simple because it did not succeed in proving the three laws. We are now going to go through the proofs of all three laws.（牛顿最重要的贡献在于，他通过万有引力理论解释了开普勒三大定律。虽然书中对这些定律有所阐述，但过于简略，未能成功证明其正确性。现在我们将逐一推导这三条定律的证明过程。）

So first, proof of second law. The second law is the easiest to prove. We had the following theorem. Several weeks ago we had proven this theorem by straightforward differentiation. If this is the sun, and this is the earth, and this angle is theta, this distance is r. That's called polar coordinates. Using polar coordinates, we found that acceleration has two components.（首先，证明第二定律。第二定律是最容易证明的。我们有以下定理。几周前，我们通过直接微分证明了这个定理。如果这是太阳，这是地球，这个角度是θ，这个距离是r。这被称为极坐标。使用极坐标，我们发现加速度有两个分量。）

One is along the direction of r, the other is along the direction of theta. This is the direction of r, and the direction of theta is perpendicular to it. So let us apply Newton's law. Newton's law says that the force is equal to m a. You multiply this by m, should be equal to force. But the force is only in the r direction, so therefore the theta direction has to be equal to zero. In other words, Newton's law says two r dot theta dot plus r theta double dot is equal to zero.（一个是沿着r的方向，另一个是沿着θ的方向。这是r的方向，而θ的方向与之垂直。让我们应用牛顿定律。牛顿定律说力等于m乘以a。你把这个乘以m，应该等于力。但力只在r方向上，因此θ方向必须等于零。换句话说，牛顿定律说两个r点θ点加上rθ双点等于零。）

There's another. We also know that this acceleration, m times that, m times r double dot minus r theta dot squared, has to be equal to minus g m m over r squared. That's the meaning of f equal to m a. Okay, let's take out the first one.

That one means d dt of r squared theta dot. That's equal to two r r dot theta dot plus r squared theta double dot. Just by straight computation.

And that has to be equal to zero, because let's call this one, this two. Therefore, r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. r squared theta dot is equal to r times r theta dot is equal to a constant.

Now, this is r. This angle is r theta dot. r theta dot dt is this angle. Therefore, one half, but one half of r times r theta dot dt is equal to area swept.

Area swept in dt. This is equal to one half of r squared theta dot dt is equal to one half c dt. In other words, area swept in dt is a constant in dt, and that's second law, i.e. this area swept is proportional to dt.

It's a constant in dt. But r times r theta dot is also the angular momentum explanation. r times r theta dot is a constant.

It's equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. In other words, the second law of Kepler is nothing but the conservation of angular momentum. As long as the force is always along the direction of r, there is conservation of angular momentum, and then there is Kepler's second law.In other words, suppose the force is not one over r squared, it's one over r cubed, or anything, which depends only on r, but with no theta component, then second law always is correct, i.e. second law follows from angular momentum conservation plus central force. Central force means that the force is always directed to the center. In other words, no theta component.Next, we are going to prove the first law, but before we do that, let me box this equation. r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. Now we go to equation 2. Equation 2 becomes r double dot minus r theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.In fact, let's put m back in. I multiply both sides by r and integrate. I get m over r squared plus r squared theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.If I differentiate this, this becomes this, multiplied by r dot, and this becomes this. Let's forget about this. It's simpler that we directly use the energy law.

We know the energy. We have proven 20 minutes ago that the total energy is a kinetic energy, one half mv squared plus u, which is mmg over r. That is equal to a constant. This actually follows from this.

Only you integrate this, you multiply this by r dot and integrate, you get this expression. But since we have already the general statement, so we might as well start from here. This is the kinetic energy.

This is the potential energy. And that results equal to constant. We call it E. And again, we divide the case into E equal to zero, E greater than zero, or E less than zero.For a particle which can go to infinity, which can barely go to infinity, E is equal to zero. If E is greater than zero, that means that when r is infinity, this part is positive. So it can go to infinity with a finite velocity.If it is negative, this part cannot become zero, because if this part is zero, this is positive. If E is negative, that never happens. In other words, case one, E less than zero cannot escape.This is the case that we'll deal with first. Later on, we'll deal with E equal to zero and E greater than zero. So let us write E is equal to one-half of m. V squared is r dot squared plus r squared theta dot squared minus mg over r. r dot is equal to dr, dc, the dc, the dt.So I can write it this way. And therefore, this is equal to one-half of m dr d theta squared plus r squared times theta dot squared. But to see the dots, woman, but we have r squared theta dot equal to a constant.We have that formula before, according to the second law. So I can use that to eliminate theta dot. So this becomes c squared over r fourth.Let us now multiply this whole by r fourth. So we get E r fourth is equal to m over two. E is negative.So you will write minus a squared to be equal to 2E over mc squared. Note that E is negative, so I write minus a squared. B is equal to 2mg over c squared.I saw this equation many years ago, of course. So yesterday, I tried to solve this equation. The more I solved it, the more complicated it became.Later, after thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a trick. This trick is like this. You have to change a variable.If you want to use this r, you can take this r to the other side. Then open a square. Then you get dr d theta.And then you divide after you get theta. It's an integral over dr of a complicated expression. You can do it that way, too, but that's not an easy way.Then I remembered there was a trick. I don't know who first found the trick. Newton must have found the equivalent trick, but he did not write it in his book.The trick is to invert r. Put r equal to 1 over rho. Then dr d rho, dr d theta, becomes dr d rho, d rho d theta. But dr d rho is equal to 1 over rho squared.So we put that in there. You get 1 over rho fourth, d rho d theta squared, plus 1 over rho squared, is equal to minus a squared over rho fourth, plus b over rho cubed. You multiply by rho fourth.You get d rho d theta squared is equal to minus a squared, plus b rho, minus rho squared. The advantage of this compared with this, it's very similar. But here dr d theta has r squared term, r cubed term, r fourth term.In rho, it has become constant rho and rho squared. So this is simpler than this. And that's the trick.When you have something like this, the natural thing is to perfect the square. So this is a minus rho, minus b over 2 squared, plus b squared over 4. That takes care of these two terms, minus a squared. So let's call this sigma squared.So we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2, r by 1 over rho. Then this becomes b sigma d theta squared, is equal to minus sigma squared, plus k squared. Where we define k squared to be b squared over four minus a squared.How do I know it's a positive number and not a negative number? It can't be negative because the left side is positive. So unless this is positive, the equation doesn't make sense. When you have an equation like this, by inspection you know what to do.You should write sigma as k sine theta, sine phi. When you do that, d sigma d theta becomes k cosine phi d phi d theta squared. Is equal to k square minus k square sine square theta.A sine square phi, which is equal to k squared cosine square phi. The reason that we do this is because the k square cosine square phi cancels. So we get d phi d theta equal to 1. So d phi d theta is equal to plus minus 1. We need only a constant of d phi d theta equal to 1. So therefore, we can write phi is equal to theta plus a constant.So we put that back in. We get rho is equal to 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine of phi theta plus constant. The constant doesn't matter.All it means is you change the origin of theta. So I can make that constant equal to 0. So I would get 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine theta. I can write this as b over 2 times 1 plus e, where e is equal to k, 2k over b. It's 2 over b times k. k is square root of b squared over 4 minus a squared.So therefore, it's equal to square root of 1 minus 4a squared over b squared. And that is equal to square root of 1 minus 2c squared over m squared g squared times minus e over m. This is a very important quantity. It's called the eccentricity.It tells you how ellipse, how much it deviates from a circle. Let's look at the expression. It's the square root of 1 minus c. c is related to the angular momentum, how much it sweeps per unit time.m squared g squared are related to the mass of the sun and the gravitational constant. Minus e over m. e is the energy of the planet. That e is clearly proportional to m. In other words, if the Earth were twice as massive, you can think of it as two Earths stuck together.And each of them would still follow the same orbit. So therefore, e is always proportional to m. So e over m is the per unit mass energy for the planet. And we get this.And this is... We shall now show that it is an ellipse. It is an ellipse because this is another trick. When you have an equation which has r in it, you always follow what we are going to demonstrate as a trick.I take this formula and multiply both by r. So I get 1 is equal to b over 2 times r plus e times r sine theta. r sine theta is y. You have an equation which both has x, y, z in it and has r in it. The way to do it is to move everything to one side which does not contain r.

And then square it. In other words, you get 1 over B over 2EY is equal to B over 2R. Now I square both sides.

So I get 1 minus BEY plus B squared E squared Y squared over 4 is equal to B squared 4R squared, which is X squared Y squared. This way we get rid of the R. R has a square root and is not convenient. Now if you look at this, it is an ellipse.This E is less than 1. How do I know it's an ellipse? Because you know when you have a quadratic equation in X and Y, we'll show that this is an ellipse in a minute. Let us multiply this by 4 over B squared. Multiply it by 4 over B squared.I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B plus E squared Y squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared Y squared. I shall define this.Oh, sorry. I get 4B squared is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared times Y squared plus 4E divided by 1 minus E squared. 2E.

1 minus E squared Y squared plus. This is 2. 2EY. This is 2E.

2EY over B minus minus 4E squared over B squared or minus E squared. What I am doing here is to divide this into squares. I move this over here and divide it into squares.I shall now define an alpha. Let me see if I am doing this right or wrong. I shall now define an alpha.Square is equal to 4 over B squared. I shall now define an alpha. I shall now define an alpha.1 minus E squared. This is equal to alpha squared over 1 minus E squared. Where Y prime is equal to Y plus 2E.So you can see that this function is an X squared. 1 minus E squared is positive. So this is a typical ellipse.If you want to write it as a standard ellipse, you have to write it like this. You have to divide this whole thing by 2. This has now become a standard ellipse. I think you all recognize it.This number is bigger than this number. Because this is divided by 1 minus E squared. So its major axis is called A. Semi-major axis.So this ellipse is like this. Let me see if I am doing this right. Yes.Its semi-major axis is this A. It is equal to the square root of this thing. It is equal to alpha over 1 minus E squared. This is called A. Minor axis is called B. It is this distance.What is this equal to? It is equal to the square root of this. It is equal to alpha. It is QED.We have now proven that the orbit is an ellipse. Before the ellipse shifted, Y' then Y. Before the ellipse shifted, this is a center. This is a focus.We are not going to prove this. You can try it. It has a standard formula.You know the major axis and the minor axis. You know where the focus is. You will find that the focus is the shift from Y to Y' just now.Okay. Now we have the third law. Proof of the third law.The third law tells you that its period has something to do with its semi-major axis. We use its area. Area of ellipse.You know that the area of a circle is πr². If an ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis, a and b, its area is πab. If a is equal to b, it becomes πa².So we know that just now we have a major axis and a minor axis. So it is definitely α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Now, one half of r²θ' is equal to ddt of area swept.We have this formula before. Because this is r, this is rθ'dt. So one half of that is equal to area swept.One half of that is area swept per unit time. So if r²θ' is equal to 2c, then it is c over 2. Because r²θ' is equal to c. Therefore, the total area of the ellipse divided by the period is equal to this. Since this is per unit area, the total area divided by t is this.So we know that the total area is equal to tc over 2. But this is equal to α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. So we have this formula. We have calculated the period.The period is equal to 2 over c. The total area is equal to this π. πα² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Then we know that a is equal to α over 1 minus e². This is the formula we just had.So we can calculate t² over a³. After calculating this algebra for a long time, we can prove that this is equal to 4π² over mg. This is in the book.But the book doesn't prove this. Because the book doesn't talk about ellipse. It only talks about the circle case.Now we are proving that this is general. And this is of course the Kepler's third law. So t² over a³ is a constant which depends on the sun's mass.Different planets have the same constant. So we have proven all three all three Kepler's laws. Next time, we are going to discuss the other two cases.Namely, e is equal to 0 and e is greater than 0. I'll be in my class in my office this afternoon between 4 and 5. Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this. So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun...

Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1. The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery. Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established. 所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things? The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho. So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine. It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one.

And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week.

I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared.

So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared. And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious. 


Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. （好的，现在我们进入下一章。我们都知道有固体、液体和气体。这本书将后两者称为流体。流体的特性是没有剪切力。我们之前已经讨论过这一点。液体没有剪切力，也没有阻力。顺便说一下，我想介绍一下强度量和广延量的概念。我不知道“intensive”和“extensive”在中文里怎么说。）

Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive.

Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure. Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject. The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute. The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years.

began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity.

Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity. And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity.

He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy.

So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed.

That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found.

So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004.

There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery.

I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property.

And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery.

Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia.

We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid.

The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order.（固体可以有不同的相，因为它可以有不同的晶体结构。现在我们知道液体也可以有超相和非超相。而现在我们也知道固体可以有超相和非超相。所有这些都基于长程有序的概念。什么是长程有序？晶体具有长程有序。液体和气体则没有长程有序。）

Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order.

So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term.

It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order.

But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things.

I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order.

All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class.

I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here.

There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom.

The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface.

The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation.

So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top.

Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere.

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance.

You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil.

So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1.

But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2.

Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever. A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath.

If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area.（如果这两者的高度相同，那么压力也是相同的。所以如果我在这里施加一个压力P，那么这里的压力也是相同的。但如果这里的面积是A，这里的面积是A'，那么这里的总重量，这个重量，或者说这个重量就是PA'G。如果A'非常大，这里的总压力就是PAG，这个比例等于A'除以A。抱歉，没有G。因为两个压力相同，所以力与面积成正比。）

And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight.

But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance.

So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy.

But what you can magnify is the force. Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this.

I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng.

So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent.

So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this.

If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow.（如果他们施加的压力过大，水流就会变得湍急。你知道湍流是什么样子的。实际上，当水从水龙头流出时，如果流速过快，就会形成湍流。它会变得混乱。这种中国都流传。一个著名的问题是：在多大的压差或中心流速下，流动会从层流转变为湍流。）

This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem.（这是其中一个著名的问题，而这个问题至今仍在研究中。但中心的林教授（C.C. Lin）是该领域的早期重要贡献者之一。事情是这样的，在20世纪20年代，著名的海森堡——那个开创了量子力学的海森堡——在撰写他的博士论文时，就探讨了这个问题。）

He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work.（他是德国索末菲的学生。他们都是德国人，海森堡并没有写关于量子力学的论文。他写了一篇关于湍流的论文，并获得了博士学位，后来他成为了量子力学的伟大奠基者之一。但他的博士论文中关于层流转变为湍流的理论是否正确曾引发争议。大约20年后，当时的研究生林家翘撰写了论文，澄清了这一争议，在某种程度上很大程度上支持了海森堡的工作。）

Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube. So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow,

Plus, I differentiate this one. Those terms would give you r dot dot r double dot. So that two cancels this two, so this is this.

And this is d dt of m v squared. That's our old friend, the kinetic energy. But what is the left side? The left side is minus d dr dt dot d dx plus.I write this explicitly, right? This is equal to minus x dot times du dx minus y dot du dy minus z dot du dz. Do you agree or disagree? Because that's what's meant by the dot product. Dot product means you write these three components down.X dot, y dot, z dot. The gradient is d dx, d dy, d dz. But once you have du dx, dx, dx, dt, du dy, dy, dy, this means minus du dt.So we have, so putting these two together, we get d dt of u plus kinetic energy. So u plus one half m v squared is equal to a constant. And that's usually called E total energy.This is, of course, something that we are familiar with. We have been familiar with already about the total conservation of energy. Now the only thing that's new is for the gravitational force.We know explicitly what the conservation, what the energy expression is. Is this U is a minus GMM divide by R. Any questions? I'm going to talk about the escape velocity, neglect air resistance. So if on Earth, you put a rocket with velocity v, of course the rocket has to overcome the resistance of air.But let us neglect that. Let us assume that the satellite or the rocket is already above the Earth's atmosphere. Let's say above 50 kilometers, there is essentially no more atmosphere.Does anybody know how the atmosphere goes down when you go farther and farther away? I'm sure you know that as you go farther and farther away from the Earth, the air pressure becomes less and less. And it's a complicated phenomenon because there is also temperature. There is a temperature variation, but roughly when you go out, you know that the pressure decreases, essentially exponentially.It's about every five kilometers, the pressure becomes half. So if you go very far, there's no more air pressure. So now let us start from that point.If I shoot the rocket at that point out, if it's too slow, it will come down. It will be pulled down by Earth. The question is at what velocity would it escape? Well, if it escapes, that means that because of the conservation of energy, that means that when it reaches infinity, it essentially has no more velocity.So if it escapes, then E equal to minus G M M over R plus one-half M V squared must be greater than zero. Because... Because at R equal to infinity, E... If it can escape, that means that when... There is no square. When it reaches infinity, potential energy is zero.Kinetic energy is positive. Kinetic energy is always positive, so the total energy has to be positive. But at zero, it just barely escapes.That means that if E is equal to zero, that means it will go out, and by the time it reaches infinity, it has slowed down to V equal to zero. So that velocity is the escape velocity. So E equal to zero gives escape velocity.And that, of course, is equal to 2 M 2 G M M. Yeah. In this case, M, that is the mass of Earth. Yeah, but the number of kilometers per second for Earth.And this number, if you estimate, is about a hundred times the speed of a car, of an ordinary car. But of course, if you send a rocket from the Earth, you must first have enough thrust to make it escape from the atmosphere. And then you have to have this speed before it can go out of the Earth's attraction.There's an R here, sorry. One of the most important events in the history of mankind is the understanding of planetary orbits by Newton. In China, the ancient philosophers did not have, from today's viewpoint, the correct view about the structure of the universe.The Greeks also had an incorrect view, but their way of thinking about it eventually led to Newton's discovery. First, in the Greek times, the most important person was Ptolemy. He lived in Greece from 90 to 168 AD.The way that he was thinking, and in fact the way all the Greeks were thinking, was that the Earth is at the center of the universe. And furthermore, they had the following feeling. They wanted to construct a universe which is most beautiful.Because they believed God must create a most perfect, most beautiful structure. And what is most beautiful? The circle is most beautiful. So they called it the harmony of circles.They thought that the Earth is at the center of the universe, and the stars, the planets, would all go around in circles. But that's not correct. By observation, they knew that, for example, the motion of Mars is very complicated.So they thought it's not a circle. The next complicated but beautiful thing is a circle on a circle. What is a circle on a circle? If you have a ball here, and a circle, while the center is moving in a big circle, there's a particle which goes around this, so you would get something like this.That's called circle on circle. And they tried to adjust the sizes of these two circles to make it match the motion of the planets. It didn't work.So they make it a circle on a circle on a circle. And since there are many planets, so there are many circles, and at one point, somebody had the complete structure of the planets' motion. There were 80 some circles.And that was the general way of thinking about planetary motion. Now why are planetary motions so very important? Because there's agriculture. When you develop agriculture, you know that agriculture depends on the understanding of the seasons.And understanding of the seasons depends on understanding of the motion of the stars around the Earth as you see them. So that astronomy is an important subject in every civilization. It's an obvious thing.Because if you develop agriculture, then astronomy becomes important. But there are regularities of the motion of the stars, of the planets. But there are also strange motions.So people began to try to puzzle out these strange motions. And therefore, this circle on circle on circle kind of idea. That held back Western astronomy for more than 2,000 years, until Copernicus.He advocated heliocenter theory. You all know that Galileo subscribed to this theory. Galileo believed in this theory and was persecuted by the Catholic Church.Nevertheless, many astronomers began to think about the heliocenter theory. The next important development was Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe was an observer.He made accurate measurements of the position of various planets year after year. And after he died, his data was analyzed by Kepler. So Brahe was an experimental astronomer.Kepler was a theoretical astronomer. It was very interesting how Kepler made his great discoveries. He concentrated on the motion of Mars.And the motion of Mars, according to Copernicus' idea, was mostly a circle. In fact, the orbit of Mars as we know it today is almost a circle. But because Brahe's data was very accurate, so Kepler was able to accurately map the position of Mars and found that it's not a circle.It doesn't fit a circle. It almost fits a circle, but not quite. And then one day he suddenly realized it's not a circle at all.It's an ellipse. This is one of the most important events in the history of mankind. The reason that he could land on the idea of an ellipse is also because the Greeks had studied ellipses in detail.We all know, and I'm sure you have learned, plane geometry, Euclid's geometry in high schools. But the Greeks developed geometry much more than Euclid. After Euclid, they studied what is called a conic section.A conic section is you take a cone, take a circular cone, and you can cut it. If you cut it this way, obviously it's a circle. If you cut it this way, it's an ellipse.So this way you get a circle. This way you get an ellipse. If you cut it this way, then it has two branches.One cut in the top, one cut in the bottom. You get a hyperbola. Circle is a circle.

Ellipse is a cone. Hyperbola is called a conic section. All of these curves, their relationship to each other, and their relationship to the cone, were studied in great detail.Beautiful work in Greek times after Euclid. And Kepler, being a theorist, knew these conic section results very well. That is perhaps the reason why it dawned on him one day that the reason that one cannot fit a circular orbit to the trajectory of Mars was because it's not a circle, it is an ellipse.And once that's done, he formulated the three laws. These laws, in today's language, are called empirical laws. Empirical means experimental.The first law is that planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. An ellipse always has two focuses. An ellipse has something called ellipticity.I think ellipticity is called ellipticity, right? Ellipticity. When this ellipticity is zero, it is a circle. When it is one, it is a parabola.When it is greater than one, it is a hyperbola. We'll come to this later. So the first law says that all planetary orbits are ellipses.And that was very accurately correct for a long time. Then, of course, when people had more accurate measurements, they found slight corrections to this. And that correction needed additional considerations.And that's outside of our discussion this semester. The second law says that a planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. This is what it means.When a planet is moving, for example, in one unit time, it has a small triangle. In another unit time, these triangles are in the same area. As it goes around.A planet sweeps the same amount of area each unit time. The way that he formulated this law shows that he was a very geometrical person. He evidently plotted the curves and observed that when the planet moves slower, that when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower.But this distance is longer, and this area becomes the same. So, when it comes to here, it moves very fast. But in the unit time, it still sweeps the same area.The third law says the period, cube, divided by... T is the period around the sun. A is the semi-major axis. From this point to this point, that distance is called 2A.Different satellites all around the same sun share the same value of T cubed divided by... T squared divided by A cubed. Sorry, T squared. Kepler died in the year 1630.A few years later, Newton was born. Newton explained. Newton was both an experimentalist and a theorist.He was a great experimentalist as well as a theorist. But perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind was his discovery of calculus, of the origin of the planetary motion,

The most important contribution of Newton was he explained the three laws, Kepler's three laws, through the theory of gravitation. These three laws are explained in the book, but it was too simple because it did not succeed in proving the three laws. We are now going to go through the proofs of all three laws.

So first, proof of second law. The second law is the easiest to prove. We had the following theorem.

Several weeks ago we had proven this theorem by straightforward differentiation. If this is the sun, and this is the earth, and this angle is theta, this distance is r. That's called polar coordinates. Using polar coordinates, we found that acceleration has two components.

One is along the direction of r, the other is along the direction of theta. This is the direction of r, and the direction of theta is perpendicular to it. So let us apply Newton's law.

Newton's law says that the force is equal to m a. You multiply this by m, should be equal to force. But the force is only in the r direction, so therefore the theta direction has to be equal to zero. In other words, Newton's law says two r dot theta dot plus r theta double dot is equal to zero.

There's another. We also know that this acceleration, m times that, m times r double dot minus r theta dot squared, has to be equal to minus g m m over r squared. That's the meaning of f equal to m a. Okay, let's take out the first one.

That one means d dt of r squared theta dot. That's equal to two r r dot theta dot plus r squared theta double dot. Just by straight computation.

And that has to be equal to zero, because let's call this one, this two. Therefore, r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. r squared theta dot is equal to r times r theta dot is equal to a constant.

Now, this is r. This angle is r theta dot. r theta dot dt is this angle. Therefore, one half, but one half of r times r theta dot dt is equal to area swept.

Area swept in dt. This is equal to one half of r squared theta dot dt is equal to one half c dt. In other words, area swept in dt is a constant in dt, and that's second law, i.e. this area swept is proportional to dt.

It's a constant in dt. But r times r theta dot is also the angular momentum explanation. r times r theta dot is a constant.

It's equivalent to conservation of angular momentum. In other words, the second law of Kepler is nothing but the conservation of angular momentum. As long as the force is always along the direction of r, there is conservation of angular momentum, and then there is Kepler's second law.In other words, suppose the force is not one over r squared, it's one over r cubed, or anything, which depends only on r, but with no theta component, then second law always is correct, i.e. second law follows from angular momentum conservation plus central force. Central force means that the force is always directed to the center. In other words, no theta component.Next, we are going to prove the first law, but before we do that, let me box this equation. r squared theta dot is equal to a constant. Now we go to equation 2. Equation 2 becomes r double dot minus r theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.In fact, let's put m back in. I multiply both sides by r and integrate. I get m over r squared plus r squared theta dot squared is equal to minus gm over r squared.If I differentiate this, this becomes this, multiplied by r dot, and this becomes this. Let's forget about this. It's simpler that we directly use the energy law.

We know the energy. We have proven 20 minutes ago that the total energy is a kinetic energy, one half mv squared plus u, which is mmg over r. That is equal to a constant. This actually follows from this.

Only you integrate this, you multiply this by r dot and integrate, you get this expression. But since we have already the general statement, so we might as well start from here. This is the kinetic energy.

This is the potential energy. And that results equal to constant. We call it E. And again, we divide the case into E equal to zero, E greater than zero, or E less than zero.For a particle which can go to infinity, which can barely go to infinity, E is equal to zero. If E is greater than zero, that means that when r is infinity, this part is positive. So it can go to infinity with a finite velocity.If it is negative, this part cannot become zero, because if this part is zero, this is positive. If E is negative, that never happens. In other words, case one, E less than zero cannot escape.This is the case that we'll deal with first. Later on, we'll deal with E equal to zero and E greater than zero. So let us write E is equal to one-half of m. V squared is r dot squared plus r squared theta dot squared minus mg over r. r dot is equal to dr, dc, the dc, the dt.So I can write it this way. And therefore, this is equal to one-half of m dr d theta squared plus r squared times theta dot squared. But to see the dots, woman, but we have r squared theta dot equal to a constant.We have that formula before, according to the second law. So I can use that to eliminate theta dot. So this becomes c squared over r fourth.Let us now multiply this whole by r fourth. So we get E r fourth is equal to m over two. E is negative.So you will write minus a squared to be equal to 2E over mc squared. Note that E is negative, so I write minus a squared. B is equal to 2mg over c squared.I saw this equation many years ago, of course. So yesterday, I tried to solve this equation. The more I solved it, the more complicated it became.Later, after thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a trick. This trick is like this. You have to change a variable.If you want to use this r, you can take this r to the other side. Then open a square. Then you get dr d theta.And then you divide after you get theta. It's an integral over dr of a complicated expression. You can do it that way, too, but that's not an easy way.Then I remembered there was a trick. I don't know who first found the trick. Newton must have found the equivalent trick, but he did not write it in his book.The trick is to invert r. Put r equal to 1 over rho. Then dr d rho, dr d theta, becomes dr d rho, d rho d theta. But dr d rho is equal to 1 over rho squared.So we put that in there. You get 1 over rho fourth, d rho d theta squared, plus 1 over rho squared, is equal to minus a squared over rho fourth, plus b over rho cubed. You multiply by rho fourth.You get d rho d theta squared is equal to minus a squared, plus b rho, minus rho squared. The advantage of this compared with this, it's very similar. But here dr d theta has r squared term, r cubed term, r fourth term.In rho, it has become constant rho and rho squared. So this is simpler than this. And that's the trick.When you have something like this, the natural thing is to perfect the square. So this is a minus rho, minus b over 2 squared, plus b squared over 4. That takes care of these two terms, minus a squared. So let's call this sigma squared.So we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2, r by 1 over rho. Then this becomes b sigma d theta squared, is equal to minus sigma squared, plus k squared. Where we define k squared to be b squared over four minus a squared.How do I know it's a positive number and not a negative number? It can't be negative because the left side is positive. So unless this is positive, the equation doesn't make sense. When you have an equation like this, by inspection you know what to do.You should write sigma as k sine theta, sine phi. When you do that, d sigma d theta becomes k cosine phi d phi d theta squared. Is equal to k square minus k square sine square theta.A sine square phi, which is equal to k squared cosine square phi. The reason that we do this is because the k square cosine square phi cancels. So we get d phi d theta equal to 1. So d phi d theta is equal to plus minus 1. We need only a constant of d phi d theta equal to 1. So therefore, we can write phi is equal to theta plus a constant.So we put that back in. We get rho is equal to 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine of phi theta plus constant. The constant doesn't matter.All it means is you change the origin of theta. So I can make that constant equal to 0. So I would get 1 over r is equal to b over 2 plus k sine theta. I can write this as b over 2 times 1 plus e, where e is equal to k, 2k over b. It's 2 over b times k. k is square root of b squared over 4 minus a squared.So therefore, it's equal to square root of 1 minus 4a squared over b squared. And that is equal to square root of 1 minus 2c squared over m squared g squared times minus e over m. This is a very important quantity. It's called the eccentricity.It tells you how ellipse, how much it deviates from a circle. Let's look at the expression. It's the square root of 1 minus c. c is related to the angular momentum, how much it sweeps per unit time.m squared g squared are related to the mass of the sun and the gravitational constant. Minus e over m. e is the energy of the planet. That e is clearly proportional to m. In other words, if the Earth were twice as massive, you can think of it as two Earths stuck together.And each of them would still follow the same orbit. So therefore, e is always proportional to m. So e over m is the per unit mass energy for the planet. And we get this.And this is... We shall now show that it is an ellipse. It is an ellipse because this is another trick. When you have an equation which has r in it, you always follow what we are going to demonstrate as a trick.I take this formula and multiply both by r. So I get 1 is equal to b over 2 times r plus e times r sine theta. r sine theta is y. You have an equation which both has x, y, z in it and has r in it. The way to do it is to move everything to one side which does not contain r.

And then square it. In other words, you get 1 over B over 2EY is equal to B over 2R. Now I square both sides.

So I get 1 minus BEY plus B squared E squared Y squared over 4 is equal to B squared 4R squared, which is X squared Y squared. This way we get rid of the R. R has a square root and is not convenient. Now if you look at this, it is an ellipse.This E is less than 1. How do I know it's an ellipse? Because you know when you have a quadratic equation in X and Y, we'll show that this is an ellipse in a minute. Let us multiply this by 4 over B squared. Multiply it by 4 over B squared.I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B plus E squared Y squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So I get 4 over B squared minus 4EY over B is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared Y squared. I shall define this.Oh, sorry. I get 4B squared is equal to X squared plus 1 minus E squared times Y squared plus 4E divided by 1 minus E squared. 2E.

1 minus E squared Y squared plus. This is 2. 2EY. This is 2E.

2EY over B minus minus 4E squared over B squared or minus E squared. What I am doing here is to divide this into squares. I move this over here and divide it into squares.I shall now define an alpha. Let me see if I am doing this right or wrong. I shall now define an alpha.Square is equal to 4 over B squared. I shall now define an alpha. I shall now define an alpha.1 minus E squared. This is equal to alpha squared over 1 minus E squared. Where Y prime is equal to Y plus 2E.So you can see that this function is an X squared. 1 minus E squared is positive. So this is a typical ellipse.If you want to write it as a standard ellipse, you have to write it like this. You have to divide this whole thing by 2. This has now become a standard ellipse. I think you all recognize it.This number is bigger than this number. Because this is divided by 1 minus E squared. So its major axis is called A. Semi-major axis.So this ellipse is like this. Let me see if I am doing this right. Yes.Its semi-major axis is this A. It is equal to the square root of this thing. It is equal to alpha over 1 minus E squared. This is called A. Minor axis is called B. It is this distance.What is this equal to? It is equal to the square root of this. It is equal to alpha. It is QED.We have now proven that the orbit is an ellipse. Before the ellipse shifted, Y' then Y. Before the ellipse shifted, this is a center. This is a focus.We are not going to prove this. You can try it. It has a standard formula.You know the major axis and the minor axis. You know where the focus is. You will find that the focus is the shift from Y to Y' just now.Okay. Now we have the third law. Proof of the third law.The third law tells you that its period has something to do with its semi-major axis. We use its area. Area of ellipse.You know that the area of a circle is πr². If an ellipse has a major axis and a minor axis, a and b, its area is πab. If a is equal to b, it becomes πa².So we know that just now we have a major axis and a minor axis. So it is definitely α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Now, one half of r²θ' is equal to ddt of area swept.We have this formula before. Because this is r, this is rθ'dt. So one half of that is equal to area swept.One half of that is area swept per unit time. So if r²θ' is equal to 2c, then it is c over 2. Because r²θ' is equal to c. Therefore, the total area of the ellipse divided by the period is equal to this. Since this is per unit area, the total area divided by t is this.So we know that the total area is equal to tc over 2. But this is equal to α² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. So we have this formula. We have calculated the period.The period is equal to 2 over c. The total area is equal to this π. πα² over square root of 1 minus e² the cube. Then we know that a is equal to α over 1 minus e². This is the formula we just had.So we can calculate t² over a³. After calculating this algebra for a long time, we can prove that this is equal to 4π² over mg. This is in the book.But the book doesn't prove this. Because the book doesn't talk about ellipse. It only talks about the circle case.Now we are proving that this is general. And this is of course the Kepler's third law. So t² over a³ is a constant which depends on the sun's mass.Different planets have the same constant. So we have proven all three all three Kepler's laws. Next time, we are going to discuss the other two cases.Namely, e is equal to 0 and e is greater than 0. I'll be in my class in my office this afternoon between 4 and 5. Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this. So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun...

Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1. The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery. Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established. 所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things? The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho. So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine. It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one.

And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week.

I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared.

So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared. And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious. Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive.

Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure. Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject. The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute. The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years.

began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity.

Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity. And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity.

He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy.

So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed.

That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found.

So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004.

There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery.

I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property.

And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery.

Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia.

We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid.

The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order.

Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order.

So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term.

It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order.

But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things.

I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order.

All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class.

I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. So today we'll discuss first the static pressure. If we have a tank of some liquid, let us consider a column here where the pressure is P0 here, and the pressure is P here.

There are also pressures from the side. For a liquid, the pressure is always perpendicular to the surface. So if we only consider the vertical forces, we have P0, we have the gravitational force, and we have the pressure from the bottom.

The gravitational force is equal to the total weight. So if the area is a unit area, or let's say that the area is A, P0A is the total force exerted on the top surface. PA is the total force exerted on the bottom surface.

The height of this column is supposed to be H, so the volume is H times A. The volume times the density is the mass. That times G is the weight, is the total force. So this has to balance because it's a static situation.

So we have P is equal to P0 plus rho HG, and this is equation 15-8. So therefore we know the pressure at the depth of H is equal to the top pressure, which is usually 1 atmosphere, plus rho GH. So in a swimming pool, the pressure at the bottom of the swimming pool is much higher than the pressure on top.

Does anybody know at what depth would the pressure be 2 atmospheres? It's about 10 meters. For water, the density is equal to 1 gram per cc, and you put that in, it's about 10 meters. So after 10 meters of water, the pressure would increase by 1 atmosphere.

Now, the way we have drawn it, it's a rectangular arrangement. But suppose it's a, suppose we have water this way. Then when we talk about the pressure here, that pressure is increased by rho GH, and that is H. So remember H is always the vertical distance.

You don't take this oblique distance. Is that clear to everybody? Now, let's look at the problem 15-3. If you have a U-shaped tube, where there is water on this side and there's oil in here, this area is oil.

So let us ask, for example, how different are these two levels? To find that, first, if I do this, the pressure at these two points are all the same. You can apply this formula. The pressure at this point and the pressure at this point, the P0 cancel each other.

The rho GH is the same. So the pressure at this point is the same as the pressure at this point. But the pressure at this point, since this is water, so the pressure at this point, let's say call it B, is equal to atmospheric pressure plus rho water, G, times this distance, H1.

But the pressure at B is equal to the pressure at C. And the pressure at C is equal to P0 plus rho oil times GH2, where this distance is H2. H2 is the height of the oil. So since these two are all the same, so we get rho W, H1 is equal to rho oil, H2.

Since rho W, the water density is higher than the oil density. This is higher than this, so H1 is less than H2. And that's precisely what would happen.Pascal principle, and that's the principle of a hydraulic lever. A hydraulic lever is a very common arrangement. You have a small tube here, there's a big area here, and it's all liquid underneath.

If these two are the same height, the pressure is the same. So if I apply a pressure here, P, then that's the same pressure here. But if the area here is A, the area here is A prime, then the total weight here, this weight, or this weight is PA prime G. If A prime is very large, the total pressure here is PAG, and that ratio is equal to A prime over A. Sorry, no G. Because the two pressures are the same, so therefore the forces are proportional to the area.

And if this area is very large, you have a very large area. So that's the hydraulic brakes all follow this principle. You have a small tube, you exert a pressure on it, and then it can sustain a very large weight.

But of course, if you do work on it, then if you press this down by one inch, if this area is very large, this displacement is very small. So you gain by having a much larger force, but you have to press a large distance. If you want to do any work, then you have to press a large distance and raise this side by a small distance.

So you don't gain in any work, but you gain in any force. Does everybody understand this one? So the hydraulic pressure is not one for which you magnify the work. You can magnify the work because there's conservation of energy.

But what you can magnify is the force. Next we talk about the Archimedes principle. Please read this.

I'm sure you have all learned this in high school. Steady flow motion is also called laminar flow. Laminar is yi cheng, yi cheng, yi cheng.

So if you have a tube, xiang yi shui guan, if you apply pressure on the side, then the water would flow inside, but the water near the surface would flow with a zero velocity, because there's friction. The contact with the tube would slow down the water, but the water in the center would flow rapidly. So if you plot the velocity, this is the tube, you would get a velocity which looks like this.The water in the center flows fastest. The water on the edge flows slowest. So you can think of the flow as many layers.

Each layer is a tube, and the center tube would be flowing fastest. And that is a typical laminar flow. However, if you now apply much larger pressure, then it will move faster and faster, and when it reaches a certain speed, it becomes turbulent.

So you can go from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. This is a very complicated subject, but it is an extremely important subject because it has tremendous applications. Not only is it important for the water company, the water company has to pay attention to this.

If they apply too much pressure, it will become turbulent. You know what a turbulent flow is like. In fact, when water comes out of the faucet, if it goes too fast, it becomes turbulent.It becomes luan. Zhe zhe zhong guo dou chuan liu. A famous problem was the problem of at what pressure difference or what speed at the center would the flow go from laminar flow to a turbulent flow.

This is one of the famous problems, and this problem is still being investigated today. But Professor C.C. Lin of the Center was one of the early important contributors to this field. What happened was that in the 1920s, Heisenberg, the famous Heisenberg, the one who started the quantum mechanics, in writing his PhD thesis, wrote about this problem.

He was a student of Sommerfeld in Germany. They were both Germans, and Heisenberg did not write a thesis on quantum mechanics. He wrote a thesis on turbulent flow.And he got his PhD, and then he went on to become a great founder of quantum mechanics. But his PhD thesis was under dispute about whether his theory of the change from laminar flow to turbulent flow was correct. And then some 20 years later, C.C. Lin, then a graduate student, wrote his thesis, which clarified the situation, and in some sense it mostly supported Heisenberg's work.

Both Heisenberg's work and C.C. Lin's work were very important at the time. And Lin later became a very distinguished professor at MIT. He's now a professor at the Center in Tsinghua.The turbulent flow is especially important because of the airplane industry. When an airplane flies very fast, there's turbulence near the airplane, especially under the wings. And that turbulence creates an energy drag, because the turbulent flow consumes energy.And so therefore, in order to save fuel, you have to understand the theory of turbulent flow. So it is a very important subject, and in departments of aerodynamics, turbulent flow is one of the most important subjects. Equation of continuity.If you have a tube, well, this can be a tube inside a big tube. So what I'm drawing are the lines of flow. It could be in a very big tube.If this area is A, and this area is A prime, and we are talking about an incomprehensible flow,

Incompressible flow, incompressible is not compressible. In other words, the density cannot be changed. For example, air is a compressible flow.Because if you add pressure to the air, it becomes denser. But water is essentially incompressible. If you add a lot of pressure, the density of the water will have a small change.So, mostly talking about the water, it's an incompressible flow. Now let's talk about the incompressible flow. If this is A, and this velocity is v, and this velocity is v'.Now, very clearly, A times v times delta t, in a time delta t, you would have a distance of v delta t times an area. So you get that this is the total volume of liquid that enters this area. And that must be equal to the amount which goes out, because you cannot compress it.So therefore, this is equal to A prime v prime delta t. So A v is equal to A prime v prime. In other words, the velocity is inversely proportional to the area. That's, of course, obvious.If you have a river, which is very narrow, and suddenly becomes very wide, then the fast flow in the narrow part, upon coming to the wide part, would slow down. Obviously. Bernoulli was a very distinguished family.That family produced a number of important mathematicians and scientists. There is a chapter about the Bernoulli family in the book that I had recommended to you called The Name of Mathematics. And Bernoulli's equation is something like this.Suppose you have this is the y-axis. This is a vertical upwards. Suppose you have a tube which goes this way.Let us consider a flow which goes this way. And we already know that the area here is smaller, the area here is larger, so therefore the velocity here is larger than the velocity here. So let us say after a delta t, this thing goes to here.So it goes from the solid line to the dotted line. Now we want to consider energy conservation. Again, these are not necessarily... we are not thinking of it as a tube.These are the lines of flow. So the whole thing may be in a very big vessel, but there is a laminar flow, so they are flowing smoothly. So at this point, there is an area.There is A1, and here is A2. At this point, there is pressure 1, there is pressure 2. At this point, there is V1, there is V2. Now we know A1V1 is equal to A2V2.We already had that. What does energy conservation say? Energy conservation says that the work done on the water in this region is equal to the energy increase. Right? That is what is meant by energy conservation.We are assuming there is no turbulence, so there is energy conservation. But what is the work done on this? This is equal to... In this side, we do work on it, and the force is equal to P1A1. That is the force.The distance traveled is equal to V1 delta t. Right? This is the force done on the system. But at this point, the system does work on the outside, so therefore you have to subtract P2A2. P2A2 is the force times the distance traveled.It's V2 delta t. So this difference is the total work done on the system. Now what is this one? What is the energy increase? The energy increase is the energy in the middle is not changed. Before delta t and after delta t, it's the same.The material may have changed, but it's the same amount of mass moving with the same velocity at every point, so there is no change. The only change is that in this area and in this area, or in this volume and in this volume. So what is the change? The change is the total.What is the total mass of it? It's A1 V1 delta t. That is the volume times rho. That's the total mass. The total mass times one half V1 squared minus V2 squared.V2 squared minus V1 squared. That's the kinetic energy change. Does everybody agree? This part is the mass.One half m V squared is the kinetic energy. So this part is the kinetic energy here, and this part is the kinetic energy here, and so it's the kinetic energy increase is that, plus the potential energy increase. The potential energy increase is the same thing.It's the same mass plus it's rho gh, or it's mgh. So g times y2 minus y1. In the bracket, here's the kinetic energy increase.Here's the potential energy increase. So let's write it out. We have now delta V. Let's write V. The volume is equal to A1 V1 delta t, and it's equal to A2 V2 delta t. So if I rewrite this equation, I get P1 times V1 times this capital V, times V1 times capital V. No, no, no.P1 capital V minus P2 capital V is the left side. It's equal to rho V times one-half V2 squared minus V1 squared plus gy2 minus gy1. So if you cancel the V, you get P1 minus P2 is equal to rho one-half rho V2 squared minus V1 squared plus rho gy2 minus y1.Or you get P1 plus one-half rho V1 squared plus rho gy1 is equal to P2 plus one-half rho V2 squared plus rho gy2. That's called Bernoulli's equation. That's 15-20.This is a very useful formula. For example, let's take, if you have a tank of water and you have a little hole near the bottom, then everybody would know that the water would flow out. This is a simple problem, 15-9.So let us apply, we assume that this is smooth flowing. If it is too large a height, it could become turbulent. But let us have not too large a height.So suppose this drop of height is H. So we take this point to be one, take this point to be two. At one, there's the atmospheric pressure plus the original velocity of one-half rho V1 squared. But if this is a very small hole, the surface drops down very slowly.So we neglect this. Plus rho gh is equal to, the pressure at this point is rho zero, is P zero. Again, atmospheric pressure plus one-half rho V2 squared plus zero.So since P zero cancels P zero, we get the rho gh is equal to one-half rho V2 squared, which essentially says that the velocity is equivalent to if the thing has to drop down from here to here. But that's not strange because by energy conservation, because we obtained this formula through the Bernoulli's equation. The Bernoulli's equation is based on energy conservation.And so therefore, of course we get energy conservation. I advise you to read Chapter 15 very carefully. There are a lot of little discussions.It's... I think you'll gain general information by reading the book. But as far as the physics principles are concerned, we have, in the last 40 minutes, have gone through the important points completely. So we now go to the next chapter, Chapter 16, Oscillations.Everybody knows that if you have oscillation, there's a frequency. There's a unit which is called a hertz. One hertz is equal to one cycle per second.And if you have a clock, the pendulum usually has a frequency of one hertz, one cycle per second. When you talk about cycle, it is the return to the original point. If you have a swing, usually the frequency is, let's say, one third of a hertz.But for radio waves, it has a very high frequency. If you go to light waves, light has been known, of course, by mankind since the beginning of history. But it was only after Maxwell that it was recognized that ordinary light, visible light, is an electromagnetic vibration.And that has a very, very high frequency, much higher than, say, radio waves' frequency. And later on, people found the gamma rays. Gamma rays have even higher frequencies.Now, if you look at the figure 34-1 of the book, it has a spectrum of various vibrations. These different vibrations go from very slow ones to very, very high frequencies. The highest frequencies are gamma rays, or hard gamma rays, or cosmic rays.Cosmic rays, some of them have enormously high frequencies. So, oscillation is a very fundamental phenomenon. It's very, very common.Now, in the book, it writes a typical one-dimensional oscillation. The displacement, x, as a function of t, is written as x0 times cosine omega t plus phi. This x0 is called amplitude, 中文叫振幅.This omega is called angular frequency. Sorry, angular velocity. This phi is called phase angle, or phase constant, or phase constant.And this, what's under the cosine, the whole thing is called the phase. The phase would usually go from 0 to 360 degrees, to 720 degrees, and so on and so forth. That the phase is the most important thing was well known once people began to study, for example, water waves.But we now know in the 20th century that the concept of phase is deeply related. The concept of phase is related to the mathematical structure of the fundamental forces of nature. There are many fundamental forces of nature.I'm sure you know the gravity force is a fundamental force of nature. Electric and magnetic force is another type of fundamental forces of nature. Then in the 20th century, we know that there are additional forces.There are the so-called strong forces, which determine the structure of nuclei. There are the weak forces, which determine, for example, radioactivity. So in the 20th century, we now know that there are four types of forces.It turns out that all these forces are related to the concept of phase. And in fact, the prevailing theory now is called the gauge theory. The structure of all these four fundamental forces of nature are all gauge theories.But gauge theory is a wrong name. There is a word in English called misnomer. Nomer means naming.Mis is wrong. Misnomer means a wrong naming. It shouldn't have been called gauge theory.It should have been called phase theory. Because its basic concept is based on the concept of phase. At the beginning of this year, I gave a talk in Germany, in Ulm.Ulm is the small town where Einstein was born 125 years ago. They had a celebration for the 125th birthday of Einstein. And I gave a talk there.In which I talked about the fundamental contributions of Einstein. And in that talk, I mentioned that what Einstein wanted to do was to understand the structures of all forces. And he wanted to have a unified understanding.It's called a unified theory. He did not succeed in his lifetime. We have not succeeded yet.But we know that one of the key ingredients of the future unified field theory is gauge theory, or in fact, phase theory. So that shows that the concept of phase is of fundamental importance in physics. Now, the equation that gives rise to the phase is, of course, this simple equation.This equation we have written down several times. And we have applied it to a pendulum. We have applied it to a mass attached to a spring.But in those discussions, we did not discuss dissipation. In those examples that we discussed, either a simple swing or a compressed spring, there was energy conservation. But in actual practice, all motion encounters frictions.And in particular, you can do an experiment. And the diagram of the experiment is given in the book. Suppose you have a spring here.You attach a mass to it. But you now produce some larger friction than given by air. So, for example, you have a range like this.You attach an object to the mass. And then immerse that object in some liquid. So when the mass moves up and down, this object moves in the liquid and creates a friction.So this way you can study the dissipation. And it turns out that the dissipation follows an equation such that m x double dot is equal to minus k x minus b x dot minus b x dot. x dot is, of course, the velocity.It gives you a force which is proportional to the velocity. So this is the typical harmonic motion with dissipation. And it's usually written in this form.Harmonic motion with dissipation. Why do we call it dissipation? Let us try to look at the energy balance of this equation. We have looked at harmonic motion before.And we have written the conservation energy equation. How did we obtain that? We take this force equation and multiply it by x dot, by velocity. So we now do the same.We get m x double dot x dot is equal to minus k x x dot minus b x dot squared. But this is equal to d dt of one half m x dot squared. It's equal to minus d dt of one half k x squared minus b x dot squared.Or, it's d dt of the kinetic energy, that's this term, plus potential energy, that's this term, is equal to minus b x squared. So, that's it.

Total energy, that's the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies, the total energy changes with time, and it's always negative, minus Bx dot squared. And that's why this is called dissipation. It's Bv squared.It's proportional to the velocity squared. That also shows that B has to be positive, because dissipation always decreases the total energy, decreases the total mechanical energy. Actually, later on we learn that if you include the heat energy, then what is lost in the mechanical energy goes into heat.So once you understand that, you eventually find out that if you add the heat energy, then the total energy is not changed. What happens is that you are changing the mechanical energy into heat energy. And after that is understood, people ask, can I change heat energy back into mechanical energy? Answer, no.

And that is the second law of thermodynamics. We'll come to that. So the simple statement of the second law of thermodynamics is that you can change mechanical energy by various means, by friction, into heat energy.But you cannot let change heat energy into mechanical energy. Okay, now we want to deal with the mathematics of this boxed equation, the harmonic motion with dissipation. This equation is a second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation.Second-order because you have a second derivative. Linear because everything is either x or x dot or x. It's only the first power. Homogeneous in the sense that every term is the same order.If you have something on the right-hand side which is not proportional to x, then it's not homogeneous. So this is called homogeneous linear differential equation of second-order. For such homogeneous differential equations, there is a trick.The trick depends on the fact that the exponential function, let's take exponential i alpha t. If I differentiate the exponential function, I get the same exponential function multiplied by constant. So if you repeatedly differentiate it, you do not get new functions. You only get the same function multiplied by different constants.And that is the way to solve such equation. So we try. We try a solution.We try x is equal to x zero times exponential i alpha t. How do I know I should try this? I just said that because when I differentiate, I get back the same. If I start with, let's say, x to the fifth power, if I differentiate it, it becomes x to the fourth power, and that's not the same as the original one. So that's very bad for trying to solve this equation.But the exponential has the property that it doesn't change form. It only becomes multiplied by something. So if I substitute that into this equation, into the original equation, I get m x zero times exponential i alpha t. The second derivative becomes i alpha squared.Each time I differentiate, I get the i alpha down. And the next one is b. I differentiate once, so I get the one i alpha. The last one is k. So do you agree that this is the equation? So that means I get, this is not zero, so this has to be equal to zero.So I get minus alpha squared plus i b alpha plus k is equal to zero. No more x. So that determines alpha. So this is a quadratic equation, so we get alpha is equal to, sorry, m. This is wrong.Minus m. So it's equal to 2m i b plus minus square root of minus b squared, or i b squared plus 4mk. Let's write that as b over 2m i plus minus omega zero, where omega zero is equal to square root of 4mk minus b squared divided by 2m. Did I make a mistake? Correct.So I can take either the plus sign or the minus sign. So let's first take the plus sign. If I take the plus sign, I get x is equal to x zero times exponential i, exponential i t times b over 2m i plus omega zero.And that, according to what we just did, is a complex solution, but it is a solution. However, if I take the minus sign, I would get this. But this is equal to x zero times exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential i t omega zero.This one is equal to x zero exponential minus b over 2m t times exponential minus i t omega zero. So I get two solutions. Both of them have a real damping term.This is called damping, damping term. It's an exponentially decreasing function of time. If the coefficient in front of t is small, if b is almost zero, in other words, if it's a very frictionless, almost frictionless motion, then this exponential exponent is very small, and it takes a long time for it to damp down.T has to be very large for that exponential function to die down. So that's called slow damping. But then we have these two exponentials, and these are complex.Now, we have two different solutions. Since the original equation is linear, I can take any coefficient of the first solution, add it to any coefficient of the second solution, I still get a solution, because the original equation was linear. So once you understand that you know what is the real solution, you just take the two of them.For example, if you add them with the same coefficient, you get a cosine. If you subtract them and multiply it by i, you get a sine function. So therefore, what do you get in general? So in general, these are special solutions.The general solution is a linear combination of the two, and so the general solution, general real solution, is x equal to some x0 times this damping factor, minus b t over 2m, times cosine of omega 0 t plus phi. Does everybody understand this last step? Why the sum of these two becomes this? It's trivial, but you have to go through that argument. So think of it.You have to be totally familiar with why those two special solutions, when you multiply by proper coefficients and add, comes to this form. This form, this cosine of two things can be expanded into a cosine term plus a sine term, and each of them can be written as the linear combination of these two, and vice versa. Any real linear combination of those two has to be of this form.Now, if I plot this curve, first I can plot this explanation function. This explanation function goes like this. And when this cosine becomes one, it touches this curve.When cosine becomes minus one, it touches the reflected curve. So the x oscillates between these two. So therefore, you get when t is equal to zero, this term is one, so you get some phase.So you get something like this. I did very well. It looks pretty good.All oscillations follow this. If you have a very small damping, then you can go on and on and on. The book has a diagram with a much smaller damping than what I have.How do you count the damping? You count the number of oscillations before it goes down by a factor of two. And this one damps down maybe after six cycles. In the book, I think that one has maybe damps down by a factor of two only after maybe 20 cycles.But now one can make oscillations with very, very small damping, such that you can go to billions of oscillations without any real change of the amplitude. What we have done in the previous section is to look at the damped simple harmonic oscillator. That is when we come to electricity, to alternating currents, that becomes an extremely important subject.In fact, the whole electric engineering department used to study only such type of equations. However, an even more important one is that the motion is periodically subject to an external force. So that's called forced oscillation.Forced oscillation has an equation like this. But it has something on the... Every term in here is a force, of course, because mx double dot is a force. Suppose there's a force which is, let's say, cosine omega t plus, let's say, phi one.This omega is the external frequency. We had omega zero. Omega zero is the natural frequency.Omega may...this external frequency may or may not be equal to omega zero. So that's called forced oscillation. So we now want to find a solution of this equation.We try...it's clear that learning from what we had done before, we should again use complex variables and only worry about how to add the solutions, add complex solutions to eventually make it real. Why do we do that? Because the exponential function, exponential i alpha t, has the nice property that every time we differentiate, you do not change the form of the equation. So should we try exponential i alpha t? No, because if we try exponential i alpha t, the x double dot is exponential i alpha t, x dot is exponential i alpha t, x is exponential i alpha t, but on the right-hand side, it's exponential i omega t, and that doesn't work.You get an equation which the left side and the right side do not match. So what should we try? Obviously, we should try exponential i omega t, because then every term is i omega t. So we are going to try x equal to x zero exponential i omega t. So we put that in there. Then we get x zero exponential i omega t times m times double dot.I get i omega squared plus b x dot, so I get i omega plus k. That's the left side. And the right side, the original, I told you that we are going to worry about the complexity afterwards. So we now just write f exponential i omega t. So that's a brilliant idea, because both sides have exponential i omega t. So therefore, so we get x zero times minus m omega squared plus b i omega plus k is equal to f. No more x. So x zero is equal to f divided by minus f divided by m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. X zero is the amplitude of the oscillation, and the denominator is a complex number.To understand how this complex number looks like, let's call it defined to be m omega squared minus b i omega plus k. Let us now go back to the k. Now we had the equation before, namely k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. Previously we had the equation for k. k is equal to m alpha squared minus i b alpha. So I substitute that in there.I get m omega squared minus b i omega plus. So something's wrong. Just a minute.I did I get a sign wrong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Minus m alpha squared plus b i alpha.So that is equal to m omega squared minus alpha squared plus b i or minus b i omega minus alpha. So that is equal to omega minus alpha times m omega plus alpha minus i b. But alpha, by definition, is equal to b over 2m, is the damping factor, plus omega zero. So I substitute that in there.I get the omega minus omega zero minus. There's an i here. Minus b over 2m i times m omega plus m omega zero minus b over 2i plus b over 2 minus i b. Right.Which is equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m i times m omega plus omega zero minus i b over 2. Let us look at this expression. This expression is the product of two numbers. A complex number and another complex number.Take the case of small damping, i.e., omega is much bigger, b over 2m. If omega is very small and is very large compared to b over 2m, that means the damping, you oscillate. If omega is large and the damping is small, that means you oscillate many, many times before it damps.So let's take that case. If that is the case, you see that this term is small. And that means, we'll come back to that.Here, omega and omega zero, so omega and omega zero are both large. We consider omega to be near omega zero. Omega is large.Omega zero is also large. But the difference between omega and omega zero to be small. That difference may be of the same order as this damping term.And here, you see, this is a large number. This is a small number. So d, in that case, is equivalent to, is approximately equal to omega minus omega zero minus b over 2m I. This is a small number.This is a small number. And this, this I b, is essentially 2m omega zero. Because this is small and omega is so equal to, approximately equal to omega zero.So you see that, what is this d? If I take the absolute value of d squared, it's equal to omega minus omega zero squared plus b squared over 4m squared. If I now take the square root of this and put it in the denominator, the x zero absolute value is equal to f absolute value divided by d absolute value. And that's equal to f absolute value divided by this number.So if I plot omega here and let this point be omega equal to omega zero, then this expression

One over this expression, the amplitude is like this. When omega is equal to omega zero, the denominator is the smallest. So the amplitude is the largest.And the width here is proportional to this. So this curve is given in the book. It's called the resonance curve.So let me put it in words. We have an oscillator which naturally oscillates with a frequency, and that frequency is called omega zero. I now apply an external frequency on it, which may or may not be the same as omega zero.Then when the external frequency is very different from the natural frequency, the amplitude is small. But when the external frequency is like the natural frequency, then the amplitude becomes very large. Now this phenomenon we all know.If you have a child on a swing, if you periodically give the child a push, if you push with the same frequency as the natural frequency of the swing, then the swing would go higher and higher. But if you just take a very different frequency, then you will not be able to make the swing go higher and higher. And when you build a bridge, for example, the bridge has a natural frequency.In fact, there are several natural frequencies. We'll come to that. Because what we have been doing is a one-dimensional problem.In general, you have a multi-dimensional problem. Then there are several ways of vibrating, and they have different frequencies. So it can have more than one natural frequency.If now you apply a force on it, and that force resonates with one of those frequencies, then that mode of vibration will be amplified. And in fact, there was a famous case of a bridge in the United States near Seattle. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.I think it was something like in the 1930s. The engineers did not calculate it correctly. And when the wind reaches a certain speed, it has a driving force with a certain frequency.And it happens that that frequency matched one of the natural frequencies of that bridge. And then it vibrates bigger and bigger. And I think something like a few hours before the disaster was going to happen, they realized, the city realized, that something very important is going to happen.So they made a movie of it. They took a real movie. And then you can see that one particular vibration becomes amplified.Eventually, the whole bridge collapsed. But in that case, there was a record. There's a visual record of that particular collapse.That is a very famous movie. You may be able to get it from the Internet. It's called the Tacoma Bridge.So the engineers in constructing anything had to estimate for every mode of vibration the natural frequency. And then try to do it in such a manner that any external force, the vibration, the frequency, would not be close to any of the natural frequencies to avoid the disasters. At this point, we have a complex solution.But we can have two different complex solutions, and then you can combine them to make a real solution. So I will not go through that in detail. But you try to puzzle that out.But I want to change it into a slightly different subject. And that is what happens if you have many degrees of freedom. What we had talked about is a one-dimensional problem.First, let's talk about the harmonic motion. Harmonic motion for small amplitudes. For discussing this, we go back to the equation of motion.But instead of talking about the equation of motion, we talk about the energy, total energy. Total energy is equal to kinetic energy plus potential energy. If you have several degrees of freedom, for example, you have a body like a molecule.It has several degrees of freedom. So the kinetic energy, typically, is like a summation of one-half m i x i dot squared. Where x i, for example, you have a molecule.Each molecule has a fixed position when it's not vibrating. x i is now the deviation from equilibrium position. For example, a water molecule consists of one oxygen and two hydrogens.Because of the full structure, it has a certain angle. So this is the position at rest. But when it starts to vibrate, each of them moves.So this one, so you have three x i's, which are the deviations of the oxygen from its rest position. And you have three for this, three for this. So you would have altogether, to start with, nine x's.So you have x1 up to x9. Each of them is the deviation of that particular molecule from the original at rest position. So the kinetic energy is like that.The potential energy, you expand into a power series of that x. So it's equal to a constant plus a linear term and a quadratic term. A linear term meaning it's a proponent of x. A quadratic term is a proponent of x squared plus a cubic term. The constant doesn't matter.All energies, because you usually take the derivative of the energy, so therefore that constant drops out. The linear term has to be zero, because if all the x's are equal to zero, it's like the bottom of the potential. So this term is equal to zero, because x i equal to zero is the static situation.Does everybody understand what I'm talking about? Let's take a one-dimensional problem. We have a u. u is the potential energy. And we have a curve like this.And we are now talking about a equilibrium point. At the equilibrium point, the potential energy is a quadratic expression, no linear term. If it's at this point, there's a linear term.But that's not a point of equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium, the linear term always vanishes. So that's what I'm talking about, because that's why this is zero.So therefore, we only have a quadratic term. And these cubic terms for small vibrations are very small, so we also drop them. So the potential energy becomes essentially just a quadratic expression.In other words, the potential energy is equal to summation a i j x i x j. That's a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression like this can be written as a matrix. It's x times the a times x. So let me summarize what I said.For a vibration of a molecule, in fact, it can be of a crystal, you have many, many coordinates. And the kinetic energy is the sum of x i dot squared with some coefficients proportional to the masses. The potential energy is essentially a quadratic expression, which can be written in this form.So the potential energy is determined by a square matrix. That square matrix can be made symmetrical, because x1, x2, and x2, x1, you can combine into one term and divide by two. So therefore, A is real symmetrical.A real symmetrical matrix by a linear transformation can become diagonal. We have used that theorem. So that means if I change from the x, which is a series of x's, into x prime, so I write x as gamma times x prime.I transform x into x prime. Then in terms of x prime, it becomes diagonal. In other words, the potential energy in x prime becomes omega 1 x1 squared plus omega 2 squared x2 squared, no cross term.And these omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 are the natural frequencies. So let me summarize what I just said. It's a fundamental idea.It's actually extremely simple. When you are near equilibrium, if you neglect the triple cubic terms and high order terms, then the potential energy is quadratic. Any quadratic form can be diagonalized, and the diagonal coefficients are the natural frequencies.So when you have the Tacoma Bridge, the Tacoma Bridge has several motions. It can do this, it can do this, it can twist. So the engineers have certain approximations of a certain number of frequencies.I don't know how many. And they can calculate that matrix and can diagonalize it. So by computation, they can know the natural frequency.And the trick is to make that bridge such that the prevailing wind in that area would not generate a force frequency which is near any of those natural frequencies. What I just said in the last ten minutes is a general principle. We know that all motions, when they are small, are likely to become almost likely to become damped simple harmonic motions.And with damped simple harmonic motions, there are two fundamental quantities. One is the damping term, the magnitude of the damping term. The other is the frequency.And that, in fact, applies to all motions. Okay, thank you. Thank you.What we just discussed last time near the end, from what some students asked me, I realized I did not make something so clear. So today I want to make a few points. First, last time we talked about a u. Originally we were talking about a one-dimensional u. Now we are talking about the equilibrium point.Why is it equilibrium? Because the derivative of u is force. Equilibrium means there is no force. So it is at this point.When it's near the bottom, it's a parabola. It's approximately a parabola. What we want to do is to have a many-dimensional problem.So think of this u as a u of x, y, z. So it's a surface. If it's a u of x, y, this is u, this is x, this is y. It's a surface. At the surface there is a point which is a minimum, and we want to discuss what happens near the minimum.So suppose there are three variables, x, y, z. Then we expand u as u zero. That's the u, the potential energy at the point of equilibrium. Then we have the first-order term, alpha x plus beta y plus gamma z. Then we have second-order terms.We have cubic terms. If it is an equilibrium point, the derivative of u with respect to x, the derivative of u with respect to y, the derivative of u with respect to z at x, y, z equal to zero has to be zero. So if I take the derivative of this with respect to x, I get alpha.The derivative of these terms, when you put x, y, z equal to zero, all become zero. So that means that this term, alpha, has to be equal to zero. So this has to be equal.This is called the first-order term. The first-order term must be zero for the point to be an equilibrium point. These are called the second-order terms.These are called third-order terms. The second-order terms and third-order terms for small vibrations are all very small. For example, suppose x, y, z are all of the order of one percent.Then the quadratic term, what are the quadratic terms? There are x squared, y squared, z squared, x, y, x, z, z, x, y, z. There are six quadratic terms. Suppose x, y, z are all of the order of one percent. Then these terms are all of the order of one thousandth.Then these are all of the order of one millionth. So for small vibrations, these can all be neglected. So these are what we call concentrates.These are of the order of one thousandth, these are of the order of one millionth. These are of the order of one thousandth, these are of the order of one millionth. You can forget about the order of one thousandth first.So there is only this. If you have not three variables, but n variables, this becomes the summation aij xi xj. So what's the conclusion? The conclusion is that near an equilibrium point for small vibrations, you can neglect high order terms and only include the quadratic terms.The linear terms are zero because we are talking about the equilibrium point. Now once you have a quadratic expression like this, you can write it as this times a times this. A is a square matrix.Then you can diagonalize this by a theorem about matrices. So after the diagonalization, so this becomes, this is x, it becomes x prime times diagonal times x prime. In other words, it becomes equal to a constant, let's say alpha 1 x1 prime squared plus alpha 2 x2 prime squared plus alpha n xn prime squared.Without cross terms, no x1 prime x2 prime. Because this is a diagonal. If you add this to the kinetic energy, it becomes a lot of harmonic oscillators.Because a harmonic oscillator, the typical potential energy is x, a harmonic oscillator of one dimension, its potential energy is x squared. Now these are all separate. So it becomes a lot of harmonic oscillators, each with its own frequency.These are called the principal frequencies. In other words, near equilibrium for small vibrations, the motion is a superposition of many harmonic oscillators, of many harmonic motions, each with a natural frequency. Let me read that.Near equilibrium for small vibrations, the motion is a superposition of many harmonic motions, each with a frequency. This is a very general statement. Next one.I went too fast last time at the end. We were discussing a forced oscillation. So it's mx double dot plus bx dot plus kx, is equal to f cosine omega t. By the way, it's not omega t, it's omega t plus phi.Then I write it as omega of t plus phi over omega. I call this t prime, then it becomes omega t prime. So if you want to change it to t prime, then there is no phi.In other words, you can always consider just to shift the time coordinate, take a different point as the origin, and use that as the new time, then the differential equation does not have the phi. So we can always consider this equation. This equation, let's call it A. Then I wrote another equation like this.This equation is B. I did not make clear why I can go from A to B. Now I want to make that clear. Suppose you solve this equation. After you solve it, you take the real part of your solution x. Then you take the real part of this equation.The left side looks like this. The right side becomes this. So any real solution, no, any complex solution of B has a real part which satisfies.Therefore, this is a very common trick. Instead of dealing with this type of equation A, you deal always with the type of equation B. Why is B better than A? Because exponential i omega t has the property that no matter how many times you differentiate it, it remains the same form, only multiplied by a constant. So therefore it's easier to solve.After you solve B, you take the real part, then you get a solution of A. So that's what I went through too fast. Third point. Last time we talked about the solution of A. Now let us write down the homogeneous equation.I call this C. This is called the homogeneous equation. Homogeneous meaning that there's no term not proportional to x or x dot or x double dot. Namely, there is no f term.Now, any solution of A plus any solution of C is still a solution of A. Does everybody agree? If I take a solution, any solution of A, add to it any solution of C, I now use that sum, and I want to prove that that sum satisfies this equation. Obviously, because when you take the left-hand side, suppose this one is called, the solution of this one is called x1. The solution of this is called x2.Now I take x1 plus x2. If you take x1 plus x2 and substitute on the left-hand side, the x2 power drops out because of this. So you are left with x1, so you get the equation of... So let me write it down.Any solution x1 of A plus any solution x2 of C is a solution of A. And that is called a general solution. So a general solution always consists of an x1 plus an x2. But the x1 part we already discussed the last time is an exponential i omega t. When you take the real part, it becomes a cosine.It doesn't damp down. As t goes to infinity, x1 does not damp. Does not damp down.
