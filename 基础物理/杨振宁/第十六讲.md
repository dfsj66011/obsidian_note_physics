Okay. Last time we proved Kepler's three laws. We did finish the third law.Right? Now let us calculate the energy. First, we had the semi-major axis. Last time we had this.And the algebra you can go through. The final result is... The interesting thing here is that this energy this means that the energy in the book, this formula was given but it was not derived because there was no discussion of how the orbit is an ellipse. It's very interesting that this energy only depends on a on the semi-major axis.That means it's independent it is independent of the eccentricity. So that means that a circular orbit and an elliptical orbit like this if they have the same major axis if the length of this ellipse is the same as the diameter of the circle then they have exactly the same energy. （好的。上次我们证明了开普勒三定律。我们确实完成了第三定律的证明，对吧？现在让我们来计算能量。首先，我们已知半长轴的长度——这是上节课推导过的，相关代数运算过程你们可以自行回顾。最终结果是......这里有个有趣的现象：这个能量值意味着——虽然教材给出了这个公式，但并未进行推导，因为书中没有讨论轨道为何呈椭圆形。最奇妙的是，这个能量值仅取决于半长轴的长度。也就是说，它与轨道偏心率无关。这意味着圆形轨道和如此呈现的椭圆轨道，只要它们的主轴长度相同（即椭圆长度等于圆的直径），就会具有完全相同的能量。）

This ellipse I drew did not look like an ellipse.Look into the book. In the book there is this diagram and it shows several ellipses of the same a but with different eccentricity. And the interesting thing is that they all have the same energy.So we have finished talking about the case of an elliptical orbit. Now we talk about the second case where the energy is equal to zero. The first one that we talked about was energy less than zero and that gave an ellipse.Now we talk about energy equal to zero. We go back to the equation. The equation becomes this.Originally there were two terms on the right hand side but the a term is now zero so we have this whole b is equal to 2md over c squared. （我画的这个椭圆看起来不像椭圆。看看书里。书中有这个图表，它展示了几个具有相同a但不同偏心率的椭圆。有趣的是，它们都具有相同的能量。所以我们讲完了椭圆轨道的情况。现在我们讨论第二种情况，即能量等于零的情况。我们之前讨论的第一种情况是能量小于零，这产生了椭圆。现在我们讨论能量等于零的情况。我们回到方程。方程变成了这样。原本右边有两项，但现在a项为零，所以我们得到整个b等于2md除以c的平方。）

In this case we again put r equal to one over rho and then we get d rho d theta squared is equal to b rho minus rho squared. For the case e is not equal to zero there is one more term.So we put x squared and again we put sigma equal to rho minus b over 2. Then the equation becomes d sigma d theta. So this is very similar to what we had and we put sigma wherever you see an equation like this you know you should put the sigma equal to b over 2 times sine phi. If you substitute that you get d sigma d phi times b over 2 cosine phi.So you get d sigma d phi squared is equal to one. This is very similar to what we had. So we take d sigma d phi equal to plus one.（在这种情况下，我们再次令 r 等于 1/ρ，于是得到 dρ/dθ 的平方等于 bρ - ρ²。当 e 不等于零时，方程会多出一项。因此我们引入 x²，并再次令 σ = ρ - b/2。于是方程变为 dσ/dθ。这与我们之前的情况非常相似——当你看到此类方程时，就应该设 σ = (b/2)sinφ。代入后可得 dσ/dφ 乘以 (b/2)cosφ，最终得到 (dσ/dφ)² = 1。这与之前的推导高度相似，因此我们取 dσ/dφ = +1。）

You can take it equal to minus one where the result is the same. So we get sigma. No, not d sigma, d theta d phi.Just a minute. So sigma is equal to equal to five plus a constant. So rho is equal to b over two plus sigma.Something's wrong. Just a minute. This is wrong.This is d phi d theta. So d phi d theta squared is equal to one. So phi is equal to theta plus a constant.The minus one we forget about. So we get rho one over r is equal to rho which is equal to b over two plus sigma. Plus sigma becomes b over two sine of phi.Sine of phi is sine of theta plus constant. But that constant if you rotate the coordinates you can forget about the constant. So we now have the formula one over r is equal to b over two times one plus sine of phi.（你可以将其设为负一，结果是一样的。所以我们得到σ。不，不是dσ，是dθ dφ。等一下。所以σ等于五加一个常数。所以ρ等于b除以二加σ。有点问题。等一下。这是错的。这是dφ dθ。所以dφ dθ的平方等于一。所以φ等于θ加一个常数。负一我们忽略不计。所以我们得到ρ分之一等于ρ，等于b除以二加σ。加σ变成b除以二乘以sinφ。sinφ等于sin(θ加常数)。但如果你旋转坐标系，可以忽略那个常数。所以我们现在有公式：1/r等于b/2乘以(1加sinφ)。）


This is equivalent to the previous case, i.e. e is equal to one. How do we change this into Cartesian coordinates? Cartesian coordinates. We change this into one equal to b over two times r plus e y. So we get r is equal to two over b minus e y. So I square this.I get x squared plus y squared is equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b plus e squared y squared. Therefore, we get x squared plus e is equal to one. So y squared is cancelled.So x squared becomes equal to four over b squared minus four e y over b. That's a parabola. When x is equal to zero, y is equal to the ratio of two. So it's here.When y is equal to zero, x is. So you get a curve like this.（这与前一种情况相同，即e等于1。我们如何将其转换为笛卡尔坐标？笛卡尔坐标。我们将其转换为1等于b除以2乘以r加上e乘以y。因此，我们得到r等于2除以b减去e乘以y。然后我将其平方。得到x的平方加上y的平方等于4除以b的平方减去4乘以e乘以y除以b加上e的平方乘以y的平方。因此，我们得到x的平方加上e等于1。所以y的平方被抵消了。因此，x的平方等于4除以b的平方减去4乘以e乘以y除以b。这是一个抛物线。当x等于0时，y等于2的比值。所以在这里。当y等于0时，x等于。因此，你得到一条这样的曲线。）


So the Newton proved that if the energy is equal to zero, the orbit would be like this.In fact, there are comets which does exactly this. When e is equal to zero, you put that into the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is equal to zero in this case. The potential energy is equal to zero at infinity.So at infinity, the potential energy is zero, the total energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. That means that its velocity is zero. So it's a particle which starts with a very small velocity, no velocity, and it gets attracted to the sun.If it heads straight for the sun... Today goes faster and faster and then it swings around and then goes out again. That indeed is the trajectory of many comets. （因此，牛顿证明了如果能量等于零，轨道就会是这样的。事实上，确实有一些彗星就是这样运行的。当e等于零时，在这种情况下，动能加势能等于零。在无穷远处，势能等于零。所以在无穷远处，势能为零，总能量为零，因此动能也为零。这意味着它的速度为零。所以这是一个开始时速度非常小、甚至为零的粒子，然后被太阳吸引。如果它直接朝向太阳飞去……今天它会越来越快，然后绕行一圈，再飞出去。这确实是许多彗星的轨迹。）

Now the third case is greater than zero.In this case at infinity, the particle comes with a finite velocity. So we do exactly the same thing. You get d theta squared plus r squared is equal to, in this case, this term is positive.Again we put 1 over r is equal to rho. And we get 1 over rho fourth times d rho d theta squared plus 1 over rho squared is equal to d squared 1 over rho fourth plus b rho third. So d rho d theta squared is equal to d squared plus b rho minus rho squared.Again with perfect squares, this becomes rho minus b over 2 squared plus b squared over 4 plus d squared. So again, we'll put rho minus b over to a sigma. Etc.This is all the same. And we eventually get 1 over r equal to rho equal to b over 2, 1 plus e sine phi. （第三种情况是大于零的情况。在这种情况下，当距离趋向于无穷大时，粒子以有限速度到达。我们采用完全相同的处理方法。得到dθ² + r²等于，此时这一项为正。我们再次令1/r等于ρ，得到1/ρ⁴乘以(dρ/dθ)² + 1/ρ²等于d²/ρ⁴ + bρ³。因此(dρ/dθ)²等于d² + bρ - ρ²。通过配方法，这可以化为(ρ - b/2)² + b²/4 + d²。我们再次令ρ - b/2等于σ，等等。这些步骤完全相同。最终我们得到1/r等于ρ等于b/2乘以(1 + e sinφ)。）


Exactly the same equation.But in this case, alpha is equal to square root of 1 plus 2c squared over m squared e squared e over m. And it's greater than 1. So we get the same formula for the three cases. But e for the ellipse is less than 1, for parabola is equal to 1, for now it's greater than 1. And this is a hyperbola. If we do the same thing, we multiply it out and do what we did before, we eventually find the following equation.E squared minus 1 y squared minus x squared is equal to alpha squared. E squared minus 1 alpha is equal to 2 or B. So what does that look like? What does this look like? Let this be a Y prime. We take a Y prime.Sorry, this is a Y prime. And Y prime is equal to Y minus. E alpha divided by alpha u squared minus 1.（完全相同的方程。但在这种情况下，α等于1加2c平方除以m平方e平方e除以m的平方根。并且它大于1。因此，我们得到了三种情况的相同公式。但对于椭圆来说e小于1，对于抛物线等于1，现在它大于1。这是一个双曲线。如果我们做同样的事情，将其乘开并按照之前的方法操作，最终我们会得到以下方程。E平方减1乘以y平方减x平方等于α平方。E平方减1乘以α等于2或B。那么这看起来像什么？这看起来像什么？假设这是Y'。我们取一个Y'。抱歉，这是Y'。而Y'等于Y减去。Eα除以αu平方减1。）

The original coordinate is here.This is the sun. Y prime, the thing is that the x equal to 0, y equal to 0. The thing is that r equal to 0. That means x equal to 0, y equal to 0. But we have shifted the coordinate by this. And the curves look like this.The particle comes here. This branch is not touched by the planet. The planet comes here and goes out here.It's very much like the parabola. Only it is a hyperbola. A hyperbola is more straight than a parabola.A parabola would be like this. Parabola is bent a little bit more. This is a hyperbola.So Newton in the Principia in 1687, in a few chapters, had completely solved the planetary motion. And he called that the system of the world. （初始坐标点在这里。这是太阳。Y轴正向，关键在于x=0，y=0。本质是r=0。这意味着x=0，y=0。但我们已将坐标系进行了偏移。曲线呈现如此形态。粒子抵达此处。该分支未被行星触及。行星由此处进入并由此处离开。这与抛物线极为相似。只不过这是双曲线。双曲线比抛物线更为平直。抛物线会是这样的形态。抛物线弯曲程度稍大。这是双曲线。因此牛顿在168年出版的《自然哲学的数学原理》中，用几个章节就完整解决了行星运动问题。他将其称为"宇宙体系"。）


Why the system of the world? Because at that time, of course, the most important thing is the planetary system.He lived on for another 30 years. He was not a pleasant man. He never married.And he became the chief of the mint. The mint is the Zao Bichang. He became the British head of Zao Bichang.And he was a very powerful person. But his discovery was universally recognized as a great event. Sometimes there is the mistaken notion that the Industrial Revolution started with Newton.That is not true. His work did not immediately produce any industrial fallout. It did not create any new productivity.That came later. But intellectually, it was recognized within a few years that here was a great discovery.（为何要研究世界体系？因为在当时，最重要的自然是行星系统。他又活了30年。他并非一个讨人喜欢的人，终身未婚。后来他成为了造币厂的主管——即“造币厂厂长”，并成为英国造币厂的最高负责人。他是个极具权势的人物。但他的发现被公认为一项伟大成就。有时人们会误以为工业革命始于牛顿，这并不正确。他的工作并未立即带来任何工业上的实际应用，也没有直接催生新的生产力——这些是后来才出现的。但从学术角度看，短短数年内人们就意识到这是一项伟大的发现。）


Why was it a great discovery? Because for the first time mankind understood that nature has precise laws.And that these laws are in mathematical terms. And that we can understand these precise laws. So you might say that that is the beginning of modern science.Science existed already before Newton. It existed both in China and in Europe. But it was empirical.It was empirical. It was not founded on precise mathematical terms. The fact that people understood that there are precise natural laws.That started with Newton. So at the time that Newton died, he was very well known. And he was eulogized by many people.In particular, here is a poem. （为什么这是一项伟大的发现？因为人类首次认识到自然界存在着精确的规律，这些规律可以用数学语言描述，而我们能够理解这些精确法则。可以说，这就是现代科学的开端。科学在牛顿之前就已存在，中国和欧洲都有其身影，但那时它是经验性的——纯粹基于经验观察，而非建立在精确的数学框架之上。人类对精确自然法则的认知，正是始于牛顿。因此当牛顿逝世时，他已声名显赫，许多人撰文颂扬他，尤其有这样一首诗流传至今。）

One of the great poets of that time was Alexander Pope, who was born in 1688. And he wrote two lines.Nature's laws lay hidden in night. God said, let Newton be, and all was light. I translated it as, nature's laws lay hidden in night.God said, let Newton be, and all was light. These two lines are very famous in history. Let's look at what Einstein said about Newton in this century.How did he talk about Newton? Einstein in 1971 said, Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. In one person, he combined the experimenter, the theorist, the mechanic, and not least, the artist in exposition. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone.（那个时代的伟大诗人之一亚历山大·蒲柏出生于1688年。他写下了两行诗句："自然法则隐藏在黑夜中。上帝说，让牛顿出现吧，于是一切都被照亮。"这两行诗在历史上非常有名。让我们看看本世纪爱因斯坦是如何评价牛顿的。他是怎么谈论牛顿的？爱因斯坦在1971年说："幸运的牛顿，幸福的科学童年。在他一个人身上，结合了实验者、理论家、机械师，最重要的是，作为阐述者的艺术家。他坚定、自信、孤独地站在我们面前。"）

I think there is no dispute that Newton's work started modern science. But there were people who were a little bit jealous. 有点妒忌他。 One of them was Lagrange.Lagrange was about a hundred years later than Newton, so he never saw Newton. But he was a great mathematician. He and Laplace developed Newton's mechanics.I have more to say about that later. But anyway, he was a great mathematician. And he greatly admired what Newton had done.But he said the following. He said, Newton was assuredly the man of genius, par excellence. But we must agree that he was also the luckiest.One finds only once the system of the world to be established.（我认为牛顿的著作开创了现代科学这一点是毋庸置疑的。但也有人对他心怀嫉妒。其中一位就是拉格朗日。拉格朗日比牛顿晚出生约一百年，因此他从未见过牛顿。但他是一位伟大的数学家。他与拉普拉斯共同发展了牛顿力学体系——关于这点我稍后还会详述。总之，拉格朗日是位杰出的数学家，他对牛顿的成就极为钦佩。然而他曾这样评价道："牛顿无疑是最卓越的天才，但我们必须承认他也是最幸运的人——构建世界体系的机会，一个人一生只能遇到一次。"）

所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不understand the system of the world, 等着Newton去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是Newton没发现我就来了。 他又说, how lucky Newton was that in his time, the system of the world still remained to be discovered. I said this also for the following reason.The success of a scientist very much depends on his times. If you move Newton to another time, after the system of the world has already been discovered by somebody else, then it is clear that Newton's contribution would not have been as great as it had been. So Lagrange was correct.And again, if Einstein were not born at the time that he was born, at a time when special relativity, general relativity were not discovered, it is difficult to imagine. （所以他是有点嫉妒, 说是大家本来不晓得, 不了解世界的体系，等着牛顿去发现。 他这句话当然就包含说是, 要是牛顿没发现我就来了。 他又说,牛顿是多么幸运，在他那个时代，世界体系仍然有待发现。我这么说也是出于以下原因。一个科学家的成功在很大程度上取决于他的时代。如果你把牛顿移到另一个时间，在世界体系已经被别人发现之后，那么很明显，牛顿的贡献不会像以前那么大。所以拉格朗日是正确的。再说一次，如果爱因斯坦不是在他出生的时候出生的，在狭义相对论、广义相对论没有被发现的时候，很难想象。）


For example, if he were born 40 years later, it is difficult to imagine that he would have made as great contributions. How does that affect you? That means that your future is intimately tied with the present scientific and technological progress.There is no way in which one can escape that. So you must, in some sense, realize what the present scientific and technological developments are like in general, and find for yourself the direction in it in which you could make the maximum contribution. Newton's Principia did not contain only what I just told you, about the ellipse, the parabola, the hyperbola.What we described is called a two-body problem. How about other things?（例如，如果他晚出生40年，很难想象他能做出如此巨大的贡献。这对你有何影响？这意味着你的未来与当前的科技进步息息相关，这是无法逃避的。因此，在某种意义上，你必须了解当前科技发展的总体情况，并为自己找到能够做出最大贡献的方向。牛顿的《原理》不仅仅包含我刚才告诉你的关于椭圆、抛物线和双曲线的内容。我们所描述的是所谓的二体问题。其他方面又如何呢？）


The Principia contains many other things. For example, it contains the discussions of the time.This is a highly complex phenomenon, because the ocean is influenced by the attraction of the sun on the earth, and of the moon on earth. So the tide is deeply related to the relative position of the sun, the moon, and the earth. And Newton had a complicated discussion of this fact.Newton had discussed the three-body problem. The most important three-body problem is, of course, the motion of the moon relative to the sun and the earth. In contrast to the two-body problem, which Newton solved for all cases, the three-body problem cannot be solved.There is no simple solution of the three-body problem. （《自然哲学的数学原理》还包含了许多其他内容。例如，书中探讨了潮汐现象——这是一个极其复杂的自然现象，因为海洋同时受到太阳对地球和月球对地球引力的双重影响。因此，潮汐与日、月、地三者的相对位置密切相关。牛顿对此进行了详尽的论述。他深入探讨了著名的三体问题，其中最重要的当属月球相对于太阳和地球的运动规律。与牛顿已完全解决的两体问题不同，三体问题不存在通解，这个天体力学难题至今没有简单的解析解。）

No simple solution at that time, no simple solution today. And that is still a problem which many mathematicians work on.In particular, there is the question of the existence of singularities. In the two-body problem, if a particle heads to the sun, but head-on, I mentioned this earlier, it would crash into the sun. That would be a singularity.But that is a very rare event. The question of whether there are singularities with many bodies is still a very complicated subject which is being investigated. And one of the problems of the singularity for a many-particle system is called the Penleve conjecture.Penleve was an important mathematician a hundred years ago. （当时没有简单的解决方案，现在也没有。这仍然是许多数学家正在研究的问题。特别是关于奇点存在的问题。在两体问题中，如果一个粒子直接朝太阳飞去，我之前提到过，它会撞上太阳。这将是一个奇点。但这种情况非常罕见。关于多体系统中是否存在奇点的问题仍然是一个非常复杂的研究课题。而多粒子系统奇点问题中的一个难题被称为彭加莱猜想。彭加莱是一百年前的一位重要数学家。）

And a hundred years ago, he made a conjecture about the many-body problem. And people have worked on it for about a hundred years.It was solved about ten years ago by Xia Zhihong. I am not sure his name is written like this. I know his name is Xia Zhihong, but I have never seen him.I think he is about 45 years old. He graduated from Nanjing University in the astronomy department. Then he went to the United States.He became famous about ten years ago because he solved the Penleve conjecture. Or rather he produced an example which had great relevance to Penleve's conjecture. In that area, there are still people who are working on it.The field that he is in is called dynamics. （一百年前，他对多体问题提出了一个猜想。人们研究这个问题大约有一百年了。大约十年前，夏志宏解决了这个问题。我不确定他的名字是不是这样写的。我知道他叫夏志宏，但我从未见过他。我想他大约45岁。他毕业于南京大学天文系，然后去了美国。大约十年前，他因解决了潘勒韦猜想而闻名。更准确地说，他提出了一个与潘勒韦猜想密切相关的例子。在那个领域，至今仍有人在研究。他所从事的领域被称为动力学。）


It is also called the quantum theory. No.How do you write the word for quantum? I don't know how to write this word. The Penleve conjecture is for many-body problem. It has to prove a singularity.The first person to prove that there is such a singular many-body problem is Xia Zhihong. He is a five-body. He produced a five-body motion.This motion can prove that there is a singularity. The quantum theory is a very popular topic now. We have discussed in detail.We have discussed in detail the case of the 1 over r squared. How about, let's say, 1 over r cubed force? In that case, the potential energy is not the 1 over r, but 1 over r squared. Because if you take the derivative of this, the force is minus du dr.（这也被称为量子理论。不，量子这个词怎么写？我不知道怎么写这个词。彭勒韦猜想是针对多体问题的。它必须证明一个奇点。第一个证明存在这种奇异多体问题的人是夏志宏。他是一个五体问题。他产生了一个五体运动。这个运动可以证明存在一个奇点。量子理论现在是一个非常热门的话题。我们已经详细讨论过了。我们已经详细讨论了1/r平方的情况。那么，比如说，1/r立方的力呢？在这种情况下，势能不是1/r，而是1/r平方。因为如果你对它求导，力就是负的du/dr。）


And that's equal to minus 2g over r cubed. In that case, we can go through the whole of the same argument. We have the energy is equal to m over 2 c squared over r. We still have r squared theta dot equal to c. This is because angular momentum conservation is still valid.So we get this. So we get dr d theta plus r squared is equal to a r force plus b r squared. So the particle will not escape.In this case, that means a is... That means a is less than 0. Because a is proportional to 1. The left side is positive. This is negative. So b has to be greater than 0. So this equation can be written like this.I write a bar is equal to minus a. So a bar is a positive quantity. Similarly, we write r is equal to 1 over rho.（这等于负2g除以r的立方。在这种情况下，我们可以沿用相同的论证过程。能量等于m除以2乘以c的平方除以r。我们仍然有r平方乘以θ点等于c。这是因为角动量守恒仍然成立。所以我们得到这个。所以我们得到dr除以dθ加上r平方等于a乘以r的力加上b乘以r平方。因此粒子不会逃逸。在这种情况下，这意味着a是...这意味着a小于0。因为a与1成正比。左边是正的。这是负的。所以b必须大于0。所以这个方程可以这样写。我记a杠等于负a。所以a杠是一个正数。同样，我们记r等于1除以ρ。）


So if you convert this, you get dr d theta squared is equal to b rho squared minus a bar.This is different from the previous one. The rho squared sign is different from the previous one. To solve this, we now put square root of b theta.This is called theta prime. Why? Because if you divide this, you want the rho squared to have a coefficient of 1. So you divide it by b. If you divide it by b, the denominator... And you take square root of b times theta. You call that theta prime.Then it becomes simpler because it becomes d rho d theta prime squared. It's equal to rho squared minus a bar over b. We call this rho squared minus q squared. q is equal to square root of... All this is very similar to what we had before, except for a sign change.（因此，若对此进行转换，可得 dr/dθ² = bρ² - ā。这与之前的结果不同，ρ² 的符号发生了变化。为求解此式，现引入√bθ，称之为θ'。原因在于：为使ρ²的系数化为1，需将等式两边除以b。当除以b时，分母部分...同时取bθ的平方根，便得到θ'。如此一来，方程就简化为 dρ/dθ'² = ρ² - ā/b。我们将其记作ρ² - q²，其中q=√(...)。除符号变化外，整个过程与先前推导极为相似。）

It's no longer minus rho squared. It now becomes plus rho squared. Does anybody know what we should do next? If it were the other way, if it's q squared minus rho squared, what did we do? We put rho equal to q times sine phi.Now we have changed sine. Does anybody know what we should do? If anybody knows, raise your hand. Li Zhen? Do you know what we should do? Whenever you encounter this kind of situation, you change sine to hyperbolic sine.So put rho equal to q times hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine. We should take hyperbolic cosine. Hyperbolic cosine equals hyperbolic sine.Its definition... Cosh of phi is equal to one-half of e phi plus e minus phi. Sine... Sine is hyperbolic sine.（不再是负的ρ平方了，现在变成了正的ρ平方。有人知道我们接下来该怎么做吗？如果是相反的情况，即q平方减去ρ平方，我们是怎么处理的？我们设ρ等于q乘以sinφ。但现在sin变了，有人知道该怎么做吗？谁知道的话请举手。李真？你知道该怎么办吗？每当遇到这种情况时，就要把sin换成双曲sin。所以设ρ等于q乘以双曲sin或双曲cos。我们应该用双曲cos。双曲cos等于双曲sin。它的定义是...coshφ等于(e^φ + e^-φ)/2。sin...sin是双曲sin。）

It's equal to one-half of e phi minus e to the minus phi.Hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are deeply related. It's just a difference of i. If you are not familiar with this, it's good to become familiar. If you want to become an experimental physicist, you don't need to be very familiar with hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.But if you want to become a theorist, you better learn hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. For example, there is a formula which says hyperbolic cosine squared minus hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one. This is very similar to the sine and cosine, except it's a minus one instead of a plus one.I mean, the hyperbolic sine in front of it is a minus sign instead of a plus sign.（它等于e的φ次方减去e的负φ次方的一半。双曲余弦和双曲正弦密切相关，区别仅在于虚数单位i。如果你不熟悉这个概念，最好去了解一下。如果你想成为实验物理学家，不必非常熟悉双曲正弦和双曲余弦。但如果你想成为理论物理学家，最好学习双曲正弦和双曲余弦。例如，有个公式表明双曲余弦的平方减去双曲正弦的平方等于1。这与普通正弦和余弦的公式非常相似，只是这里是减号而非加号。我的意思是，双曲正弦前面的符号是减号而非加号。）

After you have put that in, the differential equation becomes q, the derivative of cosh is equal to sinh, but that is equal to sinh squared. The trick is extremely similar to the sinh case. So you eliminate those, you get d phi d theta is equal to one. And so therefore you get one over r is equal to rho q. This gives d phi d theta is equal to one. So this is equal to, this is theta. I'm assigning the next steps of this calculation as an exercise for next week. I want you to plot, it's a very interesting curve. The particle does not escape because e is less than one. Next we talk about e equal to one, e equal to zero.In this case, the differential equation has the a bottom becomes zero. （当你代入后，微分方程变为q，双曲余弦的导数等于双曲正弦，但这等于双曲正弦的平方。这个技巧与双曲正弦的情况极为相似。因此消去这些项后，你得到dφ/dθ等于1。于是你得出1/r等于ρq。由此可得dφ/dθ等于1。所以这等于θ。我将这个计算的后续步骤作为下周的练习布置给你们。我希望你们绘制这个曲线，它非常有趣。粒子不会逃逸，因为e小于1。接下来我们讨论e等于1和e等于0的情况。此时微分方程的分母变为零。）


So therefore, you get d rho, you get d r d theta squared plus r squared is equal to b r squared. So we get d r d theta squared is equal to b minus one r squared. So b has to be greater than one. So we get d r d theta, d theta prime squared is equal to r squared, where theta prime is equal to square root of b minus one times theta. So d r d theta prime is equal to r. So theta prime, d theta prime is equal to d r over r. It's equal to log of r plus a constant.It's equal to d log of r plus a constant. This is a natural logarithm. That means logarithm with respect to e. So theta prime minus the constant.Let's call this a C1 theta by minus C1 is equal log of R or R is equal to exponential theta prime minus C1. I'll not plot this. （因此，我们得到dρ，即d(r)/dθ的平方加上r的平方等于b乘以r的平方。于是我们得到d(r)/dθ的平方等于(b - 1)乘以r的平方。因此，b必须大于1。这样我们得到d(r)/dθ'的平方等于r的平方，其中θ'等于√(b - 1)乘以θ。因此，d(r)/dθ'等于r。于是θ'乘以dθ'等于dr除以r。这等于ln(r)加上一个常数。也就是d(ln(r))加上一个常数。这里的对数指的是自然对数，即以e为底的对数。因此，θ'减去这个常数（我们称之为C1）等于ln(R)，或者说R等于e的(θ' - C1)次方。我就不画这个图了。）

You've got the spiral.So in both of these cases, and also for the third one, the third case is greater than zero. I'll not go through the details. You also get a spiral.So for this case, one would not get a closed orbit. You always get some very complicated rotation. It is in fact very, very fortunate that the fourth law is one over r squared.If it's not one over r squared, it's one over r to the power two plus delta, then the orbit would not be closed. If it's not closed, it would be very confusing to the early astronomer. And there would never have been any easy discovery ready for Newton to do.And there probably would be very difficult to have modern science. So how come? （你已经得到了螺旋线。所以在这两种情况下，同样对于第三种情况，即大于零的情况，我也会得到螺旋线。我就不详细展开了。你也会得到一个螺旋线。因此，在这种情况下，人们不会得到一个闭合轨道。你总是会得到一些非常复杂的旋转。事实上，非常非常幸运的是，第四定律是1/r²。如果不是1/r²，而是1/r^(2+δ)，那么轨道就不会闭合。如果不闭合，早期的天文学家会非常困惑。也就不会有任何简单的发现等着牛顿去做了。而且现代科学可能也会非常难以发展。那么这是怎么回事呢？）

Why is it that nature did things such that it is possible for mankind to discover precise natural laws? Well, we do not have the answer to that question. However, we know now that there are other reasons for it being one over r squared.In other words, one almost could have said that the reason that it is one over r squared is because God knew that with one over r squared, the orbits would be simple, and therefore mankind could discover natural laws. Some people would immediately believe that idea. But we now know there are other things peculiar to the one over r squared.Because, as you will learn later, when you learn electromagnetism, in electromagnetism there is also one over r squared.（为什么自然界会如此安排，使得人类能够发现精确的自然法则呢？这个问题我们目前还没有答案。不过我们现在知道，1/r²这个规律背后还有其他原因。换句话说，你几乎可以说1/r²之所以是这个形式，是因为上帝知道这样能让行星轨道变得简单，从而让人类能够发现自然法则。有些人会立刻相信这种说法。但现在我们知道1/r²这个规律还有其独特之处。因为正如你之后学习电磁学时将会了解的，在电磁学中同样存在1/r²的规律。）

And that was discovered in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we now know even more that both the one over r squared of Newton's law and the one over r squared of the Coulomb's law in electromagnetism are both related to an even more general concept.And that concept is one of the great achievements of 20th century physics. And that's a very beautiful principle. But that still does not come to the end of the question.Because there is still the question, why that beautiful structure? So, once you get into such kind of thinking, you will realize that the science continues to make progress. And these progress are very beautiful. But the science cannot answer all questions.（这一发现在19世纪被揭示。到了20世纪，我们进一步认识到，无论是牛顿定律中的1/r²关系，还是电磁学中库仑定律的1/r²关系，都与一个更为普适的概念相关联。这一概念堪称20世纪物理学最伟大的成就之一，其内涵极为精妙。然而这依然不是问题的终点——我们仍需追问：为何会存在如此精妙的结构？一旦你开始进行这类思考，就会意识到科学始终在持续进步，这些进展本身充满美感。但科学终究无法解答所有问题。）

## 流体

Because in the end, there is the question of why your last understanding. So that's why I always say that in the end, if you want to raise too many questions, you would become religious.  Okay, now we go to the next chapter.We all know that there are solids. There are liquids. There are gases.The book calls these two, fluid. The characteristic of fluid is that there is no shear. We have discussed that before.Liquid, there is no shear. It has no resistance. By the way, I want to introduce the concept of intensive and extensive quantities.I don't know what is intensive and extensive in Chinese. （好的，现在我们进入下一章。我们都知道有固体、液体和气体。这本书将后两者称为流体。流体的特性是没有剪切力。我们之前已经讨论过这一点。液体没有剪切力，也没有阻力。顺便说一下，我想介绍一下强度量和广延量的概念。我不知道“intensive”和“extensive”在中文里怎么说。）

Let me. And this is not in the book.But the reason I'm introducing it to you is because a student asked me. And at Young's modulus, there is a formula in the book. I wrote it down.It is force divided by area. This is a stick. I stretched it.The length of the stretch is delta L. The length of the stick is L. I stretched it. We have such a formula. This formula is called Young's modulus.A student came to me and said, why did you use L underneath? He said, all that I know is that if you stretch it by not very much, the force is proportional to delta L. So he believes that he would easily agree to F over L is equal to some constant times delta L. But why does the book write it as E over L? （让我来。这部分内容书上没有。但我之所以向你们介绍这个，是因为有学生问过我。在杨氏模量这部分，书上有一个公式。我把它写下来了。公式是力除以面积。这是一根棍子。我拉伸它。拉伸的长度是ΔL。棍子的原长是L。我拉伸它。我们得到了这样一个公式。这个公式被称为杨氏模量。有个学生来问我，为什么分母要用L？他说，据他所知，只要拉伸幅度不大，力就与ΔL成正比。所以他觉得F/L等于某个常数乘以ΔL这个形式更容易接受。但为什么书上要写成E/L呢？）

Answer. This quantity, delta L over L, is an intensive quantity. And delta L is extensive.What is intensive? What is extensive? Let's talk about intensive first. If you stretch it, I consider it as half. The half of delta L is one half of delta L. And the length is also one half.So delta L over L is the same. Whether you talk about this, or you talk about one half of it, or you talk about one quarter of it. That's the meaning of intensive.Intensive means that it has nothing to do with the size of the object. If you only use delta L, then you see that the whole object is delta L. You see that half of the object is half of delta L. So delta L is an extensive quantity. And delta L over L is an intensive quantity.（答。这个量，ΔL除以L，是一个强度量。而ΔL本身是广延量。什么是强度量？什么是广延量？我们先说强度量。如果你拉伸它，我把它看作一半。ΔL的一半就是½ΔL。长度也变为一半。因此ΔL/L保持不变。无论你讨论整个物体、半个物体还是四分之一物体，这个比值都不变。这就是强度量的含义——它与物体尺寸无关。如果只用ΔL，你会发现整个物体的伸长量是ΔL，半个物体的伸长量是½ΔL。所以ΔL是广延量，而ΔL/L是强度量。）

The purpose of this formula is to write relations between intensive quantities. So it has nothing to do with how long the stick is. So this becomes intensive.Because delta L over L is intensive. F over A is also intensive. If you stretch a stick, you can cut it anywhere.The force divided by area is the same. So this is a formula of intensive. Intensive. Therefore, this E is intensive. If you do not have this L, then this is intensive. Delta L is extensive.So this E has to be also extensive. And we don't want an extensive quantity. So this difference between intensive and extensive is a very important one.Now we are going to talk about the fluid. We are going to talk about pressure.（这个公式的目的是描述强度量之间的关系。因此它与棒的长度无关。所以这属于强度量——因为ΔL/L是强度量，F/A也是强度量。当你拉伸一根棒时，可以在任意位置截取，力除以面积的值都相同。因此这是个强度量的公式。强度量。所以这个E就是强度量。如果没有这个L，它就是强度量。ΔL是广延量，因此这个E也必须对应是广延量。而我们不需要广延量。强度量和广延量的区别非常重要。现在我们要讨论流体，要讨论压强。）

Pressure is equal to force per area.So its unit, this unit is called Pascal, abbreviated as Pa. Its unit is one newton in our system. Of course it is per meter squared.One atmosphere turns out to be 1.01 times 10 to the 5th square Pascal. So one Pascal is a very small pressure. There is a question in this book.It is in figure 15. This side is T, which is temperature in degree C. This is 1000 degrees. 2000 degrees.3000 degrees. And this side is Giga Pascal. One Giga is 10 to the 9th square.This is called a phase diagram. This side is graphite. This side is diamond.Graphite, I don't know whether you have seen graphite. Graphite is a kind of, if you have a graphite sheet, it is, if you touch it with your hand, it will make your hands black. （压强等于单位面积上的力。因此它的单位，这个单位被称为帕斯卡，简称Pa。在我们的体系中，它的单位是1牛顿。当然，这是每平方米的力。1个大气压等于1.01乘以10的5次方帕斯卡。所以1帕斯卡是一个非常小的压强。这本书里有一个问题。在图15中。这边是T，表示温度，单位是摄氏度。这里是1000度、2000度、3000度。而这边是吉帕斯卡。1吉帕等于10的9次方帕斯卡。这被称为相图。这边是石墨。这边是金刚石。石墨，我不知道你是否见过石墨。石墨是一种，如果你有一片石墨，用手触摸它，会让你的手变黑。）

It is called graphite.Graphite and diamond are both carbon. Its chemical composition is carbon. However, they are different crystal structures.Graphite is a crystal structure. Diamond is a crystal structure. If you are at 1000 degrees, this side is pressure.If you are at 1000 degrees, you bring the graphite, this side is zero. This pressure is zero. This is 2 Giga Pascal.This is 4 Giga Pascal. One Giga Pascal is very large. There are about 10,000 atmospheres.So if you put a lot of pressure on it, it will always be graphite. But at this point, when there is enough pressure, it will become diamond. Diamond, of course, is completely different from graphite.Graphite is black. Diamond is white. （它被称为石墨。石墨和钻石都是碳，它们的化学成分都是碳。然而，它们的晶体结构不同。石墨是一种晶体结构，钻石是另一种晶体结构。如果你处于1000度的温度下，这一侧是压力。如果你在1000度下，将石墨放在这一侧，压力为零。这是2吉帕斯卡。这是4吉帕斯卡。1吉帕斯卡非常大，大约相当于10000个大气压。因此，如果施加很大的压力，它通常仍然是石墨。但在这一点上，当压力足够大时，它会变成钻石。当然，钻石与石墨完全不同。石墨是黑色的，钻石是白色的。）

Graphite is opaque.Diamond is opaque. So there are different crystal structures. I want you to pay attention.Both T and P are intensive quantities. In other words, if you take a piece of stone, the T in each place is the same. The P in each place is the same.So P and T are intensive quantities. For a simple substance, if you want to know its state, you need to find out two things. One is the pressure it is under.The second is its temperature. For more complicated things, you may need to specify more things. We will come to that later.This is another phase diagram from the book. This is P. This is T. In this situation, the pressure is not so high. And this is water.（石墨是不透明的。钻石是不透明的。所以它们有不同的晶体结构。我希望你注意，T和P都是强度量。换句话说，如果你拿一块石头，每个地方的T都是相同的。每个地方的P也是相同的。所以P和T都是强度量。对于一个简单的物质，如果你想知道它的状态，你需要弄清楚两件事。一个是它所承受的压力。第二个是它的温度。对于更复杂的事物，你可能需要指定更多的东西。我们稍后会讲到。这是书中的另一个相图。这是P。这是T。在这种情况下，压力不是很高。这是水。）

This is the water phase diagram. This is essentially zero degrees. And this is 100 degrees.This is 100 degrees C. This is water. Let's understand what's going on. This is one atmosphere.This is the normal atmosphere. This means that if you are here, you have a heated system. Then it becomes vapor.So at this point, you have vapor. Now you cool it. At this point, at 100 degrees, it condenses into water.If you further cool it, it will go into the phase of water. So this is called a phase diagram. As you cool water at one atmosphere, when you reach zero degrees, it will begin to freeze.And if you further cool it down, it becomes ice. So this is the phase diagram. （这是水的相图。这里基本上是零度。这里是100度。这是100摄氏度。这是水。让我们来理解一下发生了什么。这是一个大气压。这是标准大气压。这意味着如果你在这里，你有一个加热的系统。然后它就变成了蒸汽。所以在这个点上，你有蒸汽。现在你冷却它。在这一点上，在100度时，它凝结成水。如果你进一步冷却它，它将进入水的相态。所以这被称为相图。当你在一个大气压下冷却水时，当你达到零度时，它就会开始结冰。如果你进一步冷却它，它就会变成冰。所以这就是相图。）

Now if you go to a lower atmosphere, for example, if you go to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less.In that case, water begins to boil at a lower temperature. And it begins to freeze at a higher temperature. Until you reach this point.It's 4.5 millimeter mercury. One atmosphere is 760 millimeter mercury. So this is a very low pressure.When it gets to a very low pressure, this is called a triple point, where gas, water, and solid all become one phase. If you go lower, then the gas would become solid without going through the liquid phase. So this is a typical case.This is a gas phase. This is a liquid phase. This is a solid phase.（现在如果你进入大气层较低的区域，比如到达更高海拔，大气压力就会减小。在这种情况下，水会在更低的温度下开始沸腾，而在更高的温度下开始结冰。直到达到这个点——4.5毫米汞柱（一个标准大气压为760毫米汞柱）。这是一个极低的压力值。当压力降至极低时，就会出现所谓的"三相点"，此时气体、液体和固体三相共存。如果压力继续降低，气体将不经过液态直接转变为固态。这就是典型的相变情况：这是气相区，这是液相区，这是固相区。）


But if the pressure is very low, you can go from the gas to the solid phase without going through the liquid. This is a kind of a typical phase diagram. But actually it's very complicated, because if you go to very high pressures, then water would become ice.But it turns out that there is many kinds of ice. So if you go higher, this is a very complicated diagram. It has more branches, because ice is a crystal.If you compress it too much, it would change the crystal structure. So then you would have other phase transitions. These lines are called phase transitions.And higher up, you have very complicated phase transitions. The study of phases of material is a very important subject.（但如果压力非常低，你可以直接从气相转变为固相，而不经过液相。这是一种典型的相图。但实际上它非常复杂，因为如果你施加非常高的压力，水会变成冰。但事实证明，冰有很多种。所以如果你继续加压，这会是一个非常复杂的相图。它有更多的分支，因为冰是一种晶体。如果你过度压缩它，它会改变晶体结构。因此，你会有其他的相变。这些线被称为相变线。而在更高的压力下，你会遇到非常复杂的相变。材料相的研究是一个非常重要的课题。）


The theory of phase transitions is another important subject.And we'll touch on this a little bit later. So now we talk about the phases. We have gas, we have liquid, we have solid.But this line is terminated at this point. What that means is, if you are at this point, you have, at this pressure, gas, liquid, and solid transition is like what we usually know at one atmosphere. But if you go above this point, there is no transition.What that means is that you can go from gas to liquid without a phase transition. This is a very strange phenomenon, because originally, in the early 19th century, people thought that these phases are very different. So gas is different from liquid.（相变理论是另一个重要课题，我们稍后会稍微涉及。现在我们来谈谈相态。我们有气体、液体和固体。但这条线在此点终止。这意味着，如果你处于这一点，在这个压力下，气体、液体和固体之间的转变就像我们通常在一个大气压下所知道的那样。但如果你超过这一点，就没有相变了。这意味着你可以从气体转变为液体而不发生相变。这是一个非常奇怪的现象，因为在19世纪初，人们认为这些相态是非常不同的。气体与液体是不同的。）


Not only because one is denser than the other one. Gas is, of course, less dense than the liquid. Not only because of that, but also because if you want to change from a gas to a liquid, you have to go through a phase transition like this.But then in the late 19th century, people have found that, in fact, you can have this case, where you can go from the gas without crossing any phase line, transition line, into another phase. So, in fact, gas and liquid, the division is not absolute. And that was a great discovery.So, these kind of points, where the phase transition line stops, is another very interesting subject. This triple point is another very interesting subject. （不仅仅是因为一种比另一种密度更大。当然，气体的密度比液体小。不仅是因为这个，还因为如果你想从气体变成液体，你必须经历这样的相变。但在19世纪末，人们发现实际上可以存在这种情况，即你可以从气体状态不经过任何相线、转变线而进入另一个相。因此，实际上，气体和液体之间的界限并不是绝对的。这是一个伟大的发现。所以，这些相变线终止的点是另一个非常有趣的主题。这个三相点也是另一个非常有趣的主题。）

And one of the important discoveries of 20th century physics was to have a detailed understanding of why there are phase transitions, why there could be this termination of phase transitions, and so on and so forth.In 1913, there was another discovery, namely, that you can have superfluids. There was a phase transition. It's a new kind of phase transition, which is a phase transition which goes between superfluid and normal fluid.This was a discovery by Cameron Onnes. He got the Nobel Prize. He was a great experimental physicist in a small country, the Netherlands, Holland.He alone was able to go to very low temperatures, to, let's say, below two degrees absolute.（20世纪物理学的重要发现之一，是深入理解了相变为何存在、相变为何会终止等现象。1913年又出现了一项重大发现——超流体的存在。这是一种新型相变，即普通流体与超流体之间的转变。这项发现由卡末林·昂内斯完成，这位来自荷兰小国的伟大实验物理学家因此获得了诺贝尔奖。他独自将实验温度降到了极低水平，达到了绝对零度以上两度以下的低温。）

The meaning of absolute temperature we'll come back to later. But zero degree absolute is minus 273, about minus 273 degrees centigrade.And he alone, in the whole world, was able to reach such low temperatures. And he dominated that kind of experiment for at least 10 years. began to be able to produce such low temperatures. And since he was able to produce this low temperature, he just started to test the properties of various things under such low temperatures. And he found that many metals lose their resistivity. Before that, people already knew that there is, if you have a wire, it has how many ohms of resistance. And you can measure that resistivity.（绝对温度的含义我们稍后再讨论。但绝对零度是零下273度，大约零下273摄氏度。而全世界只有他一个人能够达到如此低的温度。他在这类实验中占据了至少10年的主导地位。开始能够制造如此低的温度。由于他能够制造这种低温，他便开始测试各种物质在这种低温下的性质。他发现许多金属失去了电阻率。在此之前，人们已经知道，如果你有一根导线，它有多少欧姆的电阻。你可以测量这种电阻率。）

And resistivity is something very important, because if you want to transport electric energy from one source to another source, that transportation would require some energy.So all these power lines lose its energy. So it was well known by that time that all metals have resistance. But around 1913, he found lead at very low temperatures loses resistivity. He was in fact amazed. He made a coil, and he produced a current in it, and he just let it sit for a while. Now, at ordinary temperatures, it would quickly die down, because it wastes energy. So eventually, all the energy becomes heat, and there's no more electricity. So the electricity would exponentially go down. But he found that at very low temperatures, it doesn't go down.（电阻率是一个非常重要的概念，因为如果你想将电能从一个电源传输到另一个电源，这种传输会消耗一定的能量。因此，所有这些电力线都会损失能量。所以在当时人们已经知道所有金属都具有电阻。但大约在1913年，他发现铅在极低温度下会失去电阻率。他实际上感到非常惊讶。他制作了一个线圈，并在其中产生电流，然后让它静置一段时间。在常温下，电流会迅速衰减，因为它会消耗能量。最终，所有能量都会转化为热量，不再有电流。因此，电流会呈指数级下降。但他发现，在极低温度下，电流不会衰减。）

In fact, he produced a coil with a current. And after several months, he went back and found that the current was still there. And he was very amazed. That was called the superconductivity. So that is a new phase. And later on, there were other superconductors found, and then there were superfluids found. So these are liquids, superliquids found. So in some sense, that's another kind of phase transition. There's a last month, two months ago, a publication, September 2004. There's a discovery by Moses Chen. Moses Chen was born in Hong Kong, and he got his high school education in Hong Kong. Then he went to America, and he's now a professor at Pennsylvania State University. （事实上，他制造了一个带电流的线圈。几个月后，他回去发现电流依然存在。这让他非常惊讶。这种现象被称为超导性。这是一种新的物态。后来，人们又发现了其他超导体，接着又发现了超流体。这些液体被称为超流体。从某种意义上说，这是另一种相变。就在上个月，也就是两个月前，2004年9月发表了一篇论文。这是由陈默斯（Moses Chen）发现的。陈默斯出生于香港，并在香港完成了高中教育。后来他去了美国，现在是宾夕法尼亚州立大学的教授。）

And he found supersolids. It's another transition. This is a profound discovery. I would think he might win an Nobel Prize for this, because before that, there was no superfluid. Helium-4 and helium-3, at low temperatures, both become superfluids. But there was no solid which can become a super... which has a super property. And he found the super property. We have invited him to come to give some lectures. So next year in June, he will give a series of lectures about his new discovery. Actually, the experiment is extremely simple. It's just a small bucket. 一个小桶子,里头放了这个,放了helium-4。然后把这个helium-4,在 low temperatures and high pressure, it becomes a solid.（他发现了超固体。这是另一种相变。这是一个意义深远的发现。我认为他可能会因此获得诺贝尔奖，因为在此之前，并不存在超流体。氦-4和氦-3在低温下都会变成超流体。但此前还没有哪种固体能够具有超...具备超流体特性。而他发现了这种超流体特性。我们邀请他来举办几场讲座。所以明年六月，他将就这一新发现进行一系列讲座。实际上，实验极其简单。就是一个小桶子，里面放了氦-4。然后在低温和高压下，氦-4就变成了固体。）

That was known before. But what he did was, he took this solid and rotated it. Now when you rotate it, you can measure its moment of inertia. We learned about the moment of inertia. And we found that when the temperature is low enough, the moment of inertia suddenly changes. It suddenly becomes... if the original at high temperature, there's a moment of inertia i. When you lower the temperature, the moment of inertia suddenly becomes 99% times i. In other words, it loses some moment of inertia.And the explanation is that when the solid rotates, a part of it doesn't rotate. So the part... so the solid becomes a super part and a normal part. The normal part is a solid which rotates.（这是之前已知的。但他所做的，是将这个固体旋转。当你旋转它时，可以测量其转动惯量。我们学过转动惯量。我们发现，当温度足够低时，转动惯量会突然变化。它突然变成……如果在高温下原始转动惯量为i，当你降低温度时，转动惯量突然变为i的99%。换句话说，它失去了一部分转动惯量。解释是，当固体旋转时，其中一部分并不旋转。因此，固体变成了超流部分和正常部分。正常部分是旋转的固体。）

The super part remains not moving. As a consequence, it does not contribute to the moment of inertia. So his moment of inertia becomes less by only 1% approximately.How can something move inside of a solid? That's the thing which makes this discovery unexpected. It's one of the very exciting new discoveries in physics. So traditionally, we have gas, liquid, solid. The solid can have different phases because it can have different crystal structure. Now we know that the liquid can also have super phase and non-super phase. And now we know the solid can have super phase and non-super phase.All of these go under the idea of long-range order. What is meant by long-range order? （超固态部分保持不动。因此，它对转动惯量没有贡献。所以他的转动惯量仅减少了大约1%。固体内部怎么可能有东西移动？正是这一点让这一发现出乎意料。这是物理学中非常激动人心的新发现之一。传统上，我们有气体、液体、固体。固体可以有不同的相，因为它可以有不同的晶体结构。现在我们知道了液体也可以有超相和非超相。现在我们知道了固体也可以有超相和非超相。所有这些都属于长程有序的概念。什么是长程有序？）

A crystal has long-range order. A liquid and a gas does not have long-range order. Why do I say this? Because if you take a crystal, let's say sodium chloride, let's say, then if you know one atom of the sodium chloride, then at a very large distance, you know that it's not absolutely arbitrary. For example, if you not only know the one atom of sodium chloride, and then you rotate it, after it's lined up, you know that at a large distance, the distribution of the crystal, of the other atoms, follows a periodic system. At infinite distance, there is still an order. So that's called long-range order. A superfluid also has long-range order. And I'm very proud that I invented a term. （晶体具有长程有序性。液体和气体则不具备长程有序性。为什么这么说呢？以氯化钠晶体为例，如果你知道其中一个原子的位置，那么在很远的距离外，你也能确定其他原子的排列并非完全随机。比如，你不仅知道某个氯化钠原子的位置，还能通过旋转使其对齐，那么在远处，晶体中其他原子的分布依然遵循周期性规律。即使在无限远的距离，这种有序性依然存在。这就是所谓的长程有序。超流体也具有长程有序性。我特别自豪的是，这个术语是由我首创的。）


It's called off-diagonal long-range order. That terminology means that the ordinary long-range order is a diagonal long-range order. So a crystal has diagonal long-range order. But the superphenomena means that there is an off-diagonal long-range order. Now what is the meaning of diagonal or off-diagonal? And this is a difference between classical physics and quantum physics. With the quantum phenomena, there are diagonal and non-diagonal things. I have repeatedly mentioned to you that Heisenberg, without understanding what he was doing mathematically, stumbled on quantum mechanics, and he used a matrix. Quantum mechanics is based on matrices. （这被称为非对角长程有序。这个术语意味着普通的长程有序是对角长程有序。因此，晶体具有对角长程序。但超导现象意味着存在非对角长程序。那么，对角或非对角是什么意思呢？这是经典物理学和量子物理学之间的区别。在量子现象中，存在对角和非对角的事物。我曾多次向你们提到，海森堡在数学上并不理解自己在做什么的情况下，偶然发现了量子力学，他使用了矩阵。量子力学是基于矩阵的。）


Matrices of diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements.So in classical physics, there's no difference between diagonal and off-diagonal ideas. But in quantum physics, there's a difference between diagonal and off-diagonal. And the ordinary long-range order of a crystal is a diagonal long-range order. All these superphenomena are related to long-range order in the off-diagonal. This is a subject which is not yet completely understood. And that is why people are especially interested in the new discovery of Moses Chan.OK, I finished what I prepared to tell you today. So this coming Sunday at 3 o'clock in this room, I'm going to give a talk. It's only for the students in this class. I hope some of you will find my talk very interesting. （对角元素和非对角元素的矩阵。所以在经典物理学中，对角和非对角的概念没有区别。但在量子物理学中，对角和非对角是有区别的。晶体的普通长程有序是对角长程有序。所有这些超现象都与非对角的长程有序有关。这是一个尚未完全理解的课题。这就是为什么人们对摩西·陈的新发现特别感兴趣。好了，我今天准备讲的内容就到这里。这个星期天下午3点，我会在这个教室做一个讲座。这个讲座只针对这个班的学生。我希望你们中有些人会觉得我的演讲非常有趣。）
