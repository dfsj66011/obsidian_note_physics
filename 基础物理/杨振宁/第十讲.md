We had discussed the center of mass of a collection of particles.Now we want to talk about the theorem. The kinetic energy of a system. Now, we have summation M I times R center of mass is equal to summation.That defines the center of mass coordinate. If we take the derivative of this with respect to time, we get.（我们之前讨论了质点系的质心。现在我们要谈谈这个定理。系统的动能。现在，我们有求和 M I 乘以R质心等于求和。这定义了质心坐标。如果我们对此关于时间求导，就得到。）
$$\left( \sum m_{i} \right)\vec{r}_{\text{com}}= \sum m_{i} \vec{r}_{i}$$
求导：$$\left( \sum m_{i} \right)\vec{v}_{\text{com}}= \sum m_{i} \vec{v}_{i}$$
So, we define something called the kinetic energy of center of mass definition. Kinetic energy of center of mass is equal to one half mass as if the total mass is one point times the velocity of center of mass squared. So this is, consider all the masses concentrated at the center of mass as if it were one particle and it moves with the velocity of the center of mass.So this is the definition of the kinetic energy of the center of mass. （因此，我们定义了一个称为质心动能的量。质心动能等于总质量视为集中于一点时的一半质量乘以质心速度的平方。也就是说，将所有质量视为集中在质心处，如同一个粒子以质心速度运动时的动能。这就是质心动能的定义。）

质心的动能：$\frac{1}{2}\left( \sum m_{i} \right) v_{\text{com}}^2$

整个质心系的动能：就是各个粒子相对于质心运动速度的，$\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}(\vec{v}_{i}-\vec{v}_{\text{com}})^2$

Kinetic energy in center of mass definition. Kinetic energy in center of mass, that means you think of yourself as moving with the center of mass.And then all the particles are moving relative to the center of mass. So in that center of mass system, what's the kinetic energy? It's one half. The summation M.I. times V.I. minus V center of mass.This is the kinetic energy in center of mass system. Does everybody understand this one? Every particle moves in the center of mass system with this velocity. Okay.（质心系中的动能定义。质心系中的动能，意味着你将自己视为与质心一起运动。然后所有粒子都相对于质心运动。因此，在这个质心系中，动能是多少？它是二分之一乘以各粒子质量与其相对于质心速度平方的乘积之和。这就是质心系中的动能。大家都明白了吗？每个粒子在质心系中以这样的速度运动。好的。）

So in the center of mass system, you get this. Now we expand this. It becomes one half sum of M.I. V.I. squared minus summation M.I. V.I. dot V center of mass plus one half sum M.I. V center of mass squared.This first term is the kinetic energy in the original system. This term becomes, this is sum of M.I. times V center of mass dot V center of mass plus. (所以在质心系中，你会得到这个。现在我们展开这个式子。它变成了二分之一乘以M.I. V.I.平方的和减去M.I. V.I.点乘质心速度V的和，再加上二分之一乘以M.I.乘以质心速度V的平方的和。第一项是原始系统中的动能。这一项变成了M.I.乘以质心速度V点乘质心速度V的和再加上。)

这是**柯尼希定理（König's theorem）**，也叫**动能分解定理**，是经典力学中的一个基本定理。
$$\begin{align}
\text{质心系动能}&=\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}(\vec{v}_{i}-\vec{v}_{\text{com}})^2 \\[1.2ex]
&=\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}\vec{v}_{i}^2-\sum m_{i}\vec{v}_{i}\vec{v}_{\text{com}}+\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}\vec{v}_{\text{com}}^2 \\
&=\text{K.E.}-(\sum m_{i})\vec{v}_{\text{com}}\vec{v}_{\text{com}}+\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}\vec{v}_{\text{com}}^2 \\
&=\text{K.E.}-\frac{1}{2}\sum m_{i}\vec{v}_{\text{com}}^2
\end{align}$$
But these two terms are exactly the same except for effect of two.So what we get is the kinetic energy minus one half sum of M.I. V, which is equal to kinetic energy minus this expression is the kinetic energy of center of mass by definition. So if I now move this, otherwise we have a theorem. Theorem says the total kinetic energy, which is this term, is equal to the kinetic energy of the center of mass plus kinetic energy in the center of mass system.（但这两个术语除了“二”的影响外完全相同。因此，我们得到的是动能减去二分之一M.I.V的和，根据定义，这等于动能减去质心动能。所以，如果我现在移动这个，否则我们有一个定理。*定理指出，总动能（即这一项）等于质心的动能加上质心系中的动能。*）


Now, total kinetic energy is equal to kinetic energy of center of mass plus kinetic energy in center of mass system. Everybody happy? Chapter ten, impulse. If I have a block here, which is moving with a velocity, if I now hit it, say I hit it with a force, I give it a strong force for a short period, then it would begin to move in this direction.So its momentum has changed. The original momentum, initial momentum is equal to mass times the initial velocity. (现在，*总动能等于质心的动能加上质心系中的动能*。大家都明白了吗？第十章，冲量。如果这里有一个块体，它以一定的速度移动，如果我此刻敲击它，比如说我用一个力敲击它，我在短时间内施加一个强大的力，那么它就会开始朝这个方向移动。因此，它的动量发生了变化。原来的动量，初始动量等于质量乘以初始速度。)

Final momentum is equal to M. The difference, the vector is defined to be the impulse.Now, dP dt is equal to the external force. So dP is equal to F dt. If I integrate both sides, the left side is final P minus the initial P, and that is the impulse.So the impulse is equal to this. So we define the impulse to be the change, the total change of momentum, but because of Newton's law, this says impulse is equal to integral F dt during that period. (最终动量等于M。差值，即矢量，被定义为冲量。现在，dP dt等于外力。因此dP等于F dt。如果我对两边进行积分，左边是最终P减去初始P，这就是冲量。因此冲量等于这个。所以我们定义冲量为动量的变化，即总动量变化，但由于牛顿定律，这意味着冲量等于该时间段内F dt的积分。)

So if you have a force which starts with zero and goes to a maximum, then it bites down, like if I hit this table.If you integrate that force, integrate the vector over time, that result is the impulse. So the impulse can be defined either through the integral of F dt or defined through the difference of the momentum of the particle after and before. The two are the same because of Newton's law.（所以，如果一个力从零开始逐渐增加到最大值，然后突然施加，就像我敲击这张桌子一样。如果你对这个力进行积分，也就是对矢量随时间的变化进行积分，得到的结果就是冲量。因此，冲量既可以通过对F dt的积分来定义，也可以通过粒子碰撞前后的动量差来定义。根据牛顿定律，这两种定义是等价的。）

Completely inelastic collision. In a completely inelastic collision, the two bodies got stuck together. But Newton's law still holds.So the total momentum is not changed. So therefore we have P1 V1 M1 V1 plus M2 V2 is equal to M M1 plus M2 times V V1 prime is equal to V2 prime. We call it V. But this V is of course also the center of mass velocity.By definition, you look at this formula. So in a completely inelastic collision, namely the two got stuck together. The final velocity is in fact the original velocity of the center of mass.The original, the... Everybody happy? Any questions? （完全非弹性碰撞。在完全非弹性碰撞中，两个物体会粘在一起。但牛顿定律仍然适用，因此总动量不会改变。所以我们有P1 V1 M1 V1加上M2 V2等于M M1加上M2乘以V V1'等于V2'。我们称之为V。但这个V当然也是质心的速度。根据定义，你看这个公式。所以在完全非弹性碰撞中，即两个物体粘在一起，最终速度实际上是质心的原始速度。原始的，那个...大家都明白了吗？有什么问题吗？）

Out of that statement, we have immediately a theorem. Namely, the kinetic energy in a completely inelastic collision always diminishes. Why? Let us use the theorem we just proved ten minutes ago.We said that the total original kinetic energy is equal to the center of mass kinetic energy plus the kinetic energy in the center of mass system. Now if the thing sticks together, then in the center of mass system, finally, everybody has the same velocity. （从这一陈述中，我们立即可以得到一个定理。即，在完全非弹性碰撞中，动能总是减少的。为什么？让我们用十分钟前刚刚证明的定理来说明。我们说过，*初始总动能等于质心动能加上质心系中的动能*。如果物体粘在一起，那么在质心系中，最终所有物体都具有相同的速度。）

So in the center of mass system, the final particles have no velocity.And therefore that theorem, we had a theorem. Total kinetic energy is equal to kinetic energy of center of mass plus kinetic energy in the center of mass system. If the particles stick together and move with the center of mass velocity, then of course they are not moving in the center of mass system.So therefore this part is zero. So, sorry. In the original system, we have both of these two.In the final system, this part is zero. （因此在质心系中，末态粒子是没有速度的。根据我们之前学过的定理——总动能等于质心动能加上质心系中的动能。如果粒子粘合在一起并以质心速度运动，那么它们在质心系中自然是不动的。所以这部分（质心系动能）为零。注意：在原系统中，这两部分动能都存在；而在末态系统中，这部分（质心系动能）为零。）


So therefore the final kinetic energy is less than the initial kinetic energy. Is everybody happy with this? Thus, the total initial kinetic energy is bigger than the total final kinetic energy in such a system, in such a collision.Because both initial and final, the kinetic energy of the center of mass system is not changed. But the kinetic energy in the center of mass system at the beginning is a positive number. At the end it's zero.So therefore kinetic energy is lost. What happens to that kinetic energy? （因此，最终的动能小于初始动能。大家都明白这一点吗？因此，在这样的系统、这样的碰撞中，总初始动能大于总最终动能。因为无论是初始还是最终，质心的动能都没有改变。但开始时质心系统的动能是一个正数，结束时为零。因此，动能损失了。那么这些动能去了哪里呢？）

When we learn the laws of thermodynamics, we know that that kinetic energy is lost. But the total energy is not lost because it becomes heat energy.So if two bodies collide with a very large velocity and get stuck together, it will become hotter afterwards. By the way, that theorem that we proved, that the total kinetic energy is equal to the center of mass kinetic energy plus the kinetic energy in the center of mass system, is a very important theorem. （当我们学习热力学定律时，我们知道动能会损失。但总能量不会损失，因为它会转化为热能。因此，如果两个物体以极高的速度碰撞并粘在一起，之后它们会变得更热。顺便说一下，*我们证明的那个定理——总动能等于质心动能加上质心系中的动能——是一个非常重要的定理*。）

That theorem is not stated in the book.The book probably thinks that's a little bit too complicated. But actually it's very simple. Let us now talk about a special case that there is only one dimension.Let us first talk about the case where originally V2 is zero. In other words, we are talking about two bodies. This one is at rest, this one is moving.In that case, it's particularly simple. So we have M1 V1. That's the total momentum of the inertial system.It's equal to M1 V1 prime plus M2 V2 prime. （书中并未阐述该定理。该书可能认为这有点过于复杂。但实际上它非常简单。现在让我们讨论一个特例，即仅有一维的情况。首先我们讨论初始时V2为零的情况。换句话说，我们讨论的是两个物体。一个静止，一个运动。在这种情况下特别简单。所以我们有M1 V1。这是惯性系的总动量。它等于M1 V1一撇加上M2 V2一撇。）

If it is elastic, if elastic, this formula, this first conservation of momentum is always correct. It may or may not be elastic.If it's a billet ball colliding with each other, it's almost 100% elastic. But if it's two mud balls, then they might even stick together, so it's inelastic. Now let us talk about the billet ball case, the elastic case.If it's elastic, then the total energy is conserved. So we have M1 V1 squared is equal to one-half M1 V1 prime squared plus one-half M2 V2 prime squared. （如果是弹性的，如果是弹性的，这个公式，这个动量守恒总是正确的。它可能是弹性的，也可能不是。如果是两个弹子球相互碰撞，几乎100%是弹性的。但如果是两个泥球，它们甚至可能粘在一起，所以是非弹性的。现在让我们谈谈弹子球的情况，弹性情况。如果是弹性的，那么总能量是守恒的。所以我们有M1 V1平方等于二分之一M1 V1撇平方加二分之一M2 V2撇平方。）

So if the initial velocity is known, if V1 is known, then we have two unknowns, V1 prime and V2 prime.We have two equations, so we can solve for the two. In this particular case, the solution is particularly simple because we can write the first equation as V1. You can do this in any number of ways.A simple way is this. I first move the momentum equation into this form, and I move this part over, and I get M1 V1 minus V1 prime times V1 plus V1 prime is equal to one-half M2 V2 prime. （因此，如果初速度已知，即V1已知，那么我们有两个未知数：V1'和V2'。我们有两个方程，因此可以求解这两个未知数。在这个特定情况下，解特别简单，因为我们可以将第一个方程写成V1的形式。你可以用多种方法做到这一点。一个简单的方法是这样的：首先将动量方程改写为这种形式，然后将这部分移项，得到M1 V1减去V1'乘以V1加上V1'等于二分之一M2 V2'。）

$$\begin{align}
m_{1}v_{1} &= m_{1}v_{1}' + m_{2}v_{2}' \\[1.2ex]
\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^2 &= \frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}'^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_{2} v_{2}'^2
\end{align}$$改下一下：
$$\begin{align}
m_{1}(v_{1}-v_{1}')&=  m_{2}v_{2}' \\[1.2ex]
m_{1}(v_{1}-v_{1}')(v_{1}+v_{1}') &= m_{2}v_{2}'^2 
\end{align}$$

I really rewrote these two equations, but now this is very convenient because I can divide the two.If I divide the two, I get V1 plus V1 prime is equal to V2 is equal. Now I substitute that in there. I will eliminate the V2 prime.So V1 M1 V1 minus V1 prime is equal to M2 V1 plus V1 prime. So now I have one unknown V1 prime. So I'll get V1 prime is equal to M1 plus M2 M1 minus M2 V1.（我确实重写了这两个方程，但现在这非常方便，因为我可以将两者相除。如果我将两者相除，我得到V1加上V1撇等于V2相等。现在我将这个代入那里。我将消除V2撇。所以V1 M1 V1减去V1撇等于M2 V1加上V1撇。所以现在我有一个未知数V1撇。所以我会得到V1撇等于M1加上M2 M1减去M2 V1。）

$$v_{1}' = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1} \quad \quad v_{2}' = \frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1}$$

This in the book is equation 10 30. Once I have V1 prime, I usually get V2 prime and that turns out to be M1 plus M2 to M1 V1. And that's 10 31.V2 prime V2 is not equal to zero. Now we'll talk about the general case. Two dollars colliding, each of them with a non-zero velocity.So we have V1 V2 and V1 prime V2 prime. Now let us look at the lesson. Introduce a new notation.（书中的这个公式是10.30。一旦我得到V1'，通常就能得到V2'，结果等于M1加M2除以M1乘以V1。这就是10.31。V2'不等于零的V2。现在我们来讨论一般情况。两个运动的物体碰撞，各自具有非零速度。所以我们有V1、V2和V1'、V2'。现在让我们来看这节课。引入一个新的符号。）

So we have V1 V2 going into V1 prime V2 prime. Let us now look at the velocity of the. Of the power of the.Define V1 prime minus V center of mass. Center of mass velocity has not changed. We have already proven that.So let us call that V double prime. So now we have V1 double prime V2 double prime. These are V1 prime and V2 prime.（所以我们有V1和V2进入V1'和V2'。现在让我们来看一下速度。动力的。定义V1'减去质心速度。质心速度没有改变，我们已经证明了这一点。所以我们称之为V''。现在我们有V1''和V2''。这些就是V1'和V2'。）

定义：$$\begin{align}
v_{1}'-v_{\text{com}}&=v_{1}'' \\[1.2ex]
v_{2}'-v_{\text{com}}&=v_{2}''
\end{align}$$
But look at the center of mass system. That means it's equal to the V1 prime and V2 prime minus the center of mass velocity. So now let us try to ask, what is the conservation of momentum? Conservation of momentum means that the original kinetic energy, the original momentum, I claim M1 V1 double prime plus M2 V2 double prime is equal to zero.Because you just take. You take this equation. You take M1 V1 plus M2 V2 equal to M1 plus M2 V center of mass.You move this onto the left side and separate those two terms. You get this. What does that mean? （但看看质心系统。这意味着它等于V1'和V2'减去质心速度。那么现在让我们试着问，动量守恒是什么？动量守恒意味着最初的动能，最初的动量，我认为M1 V1''加上M2 V2''等于零。因为你只需要。你拿这个方程。你拿M1 V1加上M2 V2等于M1加M2 V质心。你把这个移到左边并分开这两项。你得到这个。这意味着什么？）

$$m_{1}v_{1}'' + m_{2}v_{2}''=0$$
因为 $$m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=(m_{1}+m_{2})v_{\text{com}}=m_{1}v_{1}'+m_{2}v_{2}'$$
That means that the two velocities.If M1 is equal to M2, that means that they are opposite of each other. That means V1 double prime is equal to minus V2 double prime. Similarly, originally in the center of mass system.I think it's actually easier if I say it in words. Originally two bodies are colliding. Let us now look into the center of mass system.In the center of mass system, we have these two particles colliding. And in the center of mass system, the first particles, P1 plus P2, in the center of mass system has to be equal to zero. （这意味着两个速度。如果M1等于M2，那就意味着它们彼此相反。也就是说，V1双撇等于负的V2双撇。同样地，最初在质心系中。我觉得用语言表达可能更简单。最初两个物体发生碰撞。现在让我们看看质心系。在质心系中，这两个粒子发生碰撞。而在质心系中，第一个粒子P1加上P2，在质心系中必须等于零。）

So P1 is equal to minus P2.Finally, P1 is also equal to minus P2. And if the total kinetic energy is not lost, if it's an elastic collision, that means one half M1 P1 squared plus one half M2 P2 squared is not changed. Okay, let's first deal with the case where M1 is equal to M2.So in the original system, in the center of mass system, you have a particle with a velocity coming, but P1 plus P2 has to be equal to zero. （因此P1等于负的P2。最终，P1也等于负的P2。如果总动能没有损失，如果是弹性碰撞，这意味着1/2 M1 P1的平方加上1/2 M2 P2的平方没有变化。好的，让我们首先处理M1等于M2的情况。所以在原始系统中，在质心系统中，你有一个粒子以一定的速度过来，但P1加P2必须等于零。）

So therefore, it's P1 is equal to minus P2. In the final system, the center of mass kinetic energy is also not changed.So can somebody tell me what happened? Originally it's P1, this is minus P2 is equal to minus P1. What should P1 double prime be afterwards? Just think of the center of mass system. You have two bodies colliding with equal mass and opposite velocity.Afterwards, it's still two bodies and still have the equal velocity, and the kinetic energy is not changed. So can anybody tell me what is P1 double prime? (因此，P1等于负P2。在最终系统中，质心动能也没有改变。那么有人能告诉我发生了什么吗？原本是P1，这个P2等于负P1。之后P1双撇应该是什么？只要想想质心系统。你有两个质量相等、速度相反的物体碰撞。之后，仍然是两个物体，速度仍然相等，动能没有改变。那么有人能告诉我P1双撇是什么吗？)

It has to go back. So P1 double prime is equal to minus P1. In the center of mass system, for two bodies with equal mass, in the center of mass system, you have this collision. In the center of mass system, after the collision, they each go out with the same velocity as originally, only change sign. How do I know that it has to be equal in magnitude? Because otherwise the kinetic energy is lost or gained.If the kinetic energy is not changed, the two must have the same velocity. In other words, in the center of mass system, the bodies each will turn back with no loss or with no change of speed. Speed means the absolute value.(它必须反弹回去。因此P1双撇等于负P1。在质心系中，对于质量相等的两个物体，在质心系中发生碰撞后，它们各自会以与原先相同的速度反向运动，仅速度方向发生改变。我如何知道速度大小必须相等？因为若非如此，动能就会损失或增加。如果动能没有改变，两者速度大小必然相同。换言之，在质心系中，两个物体会以不变的速率折返——这里速率指的是速度的绝对值。)

Is that crystal clear? Or you still have... You can prove this algebraically by writing down this formula, but we don't need that. Let me restate. We have proven that the total energy is equal to the center of mass energy plus the energy in the center of mass system.So in the last collision, the energy in the center of mass system is not changed. Because the energy of the center of mass is always not changed. Therefore, since we talk about elastic collision, therefore the energy in the center of mass system is also not changed.Okay, the energy in the center of mass system for two bodies in one dimension means there is P1, P2 colliding, and afterwards it becomes two particles.(明白了吗？还是你还有疑问……你可以通过写下这个公式来代数证明这一点，但我们不需要那样做。让我重申一下。我们已经证明*总能量等于质心能量加上质心系中的能量*。所以在最后一次碰撞中，质心系中的能量没有改变。因为质心的能量总是保持不变。因此，既然我们讨论的是弹性碰撞，所以质心系中的能量也没有改变。好的，对于一维空间中的两个物体，质心系中的能量意味着有P1、P2发生碰撞，之后变成两个粒子。)

Because going away is not changed, then the only thing that we can do is change sign. So therefore, we have each colliding, each bouncing back with the same speed, but with the direction changed. And we think a little bit more, we realize that has nothing to do with the mass.(因为离开并不意味着改变，那么我们唯一能做的就是改变符号。因此，我们看到每次碰撞，每次以相同的速度反弹，但方向改变了。我们再深入思考一下，就会意识到这与质量无关。)

If one particle has a mass, which is very small, this is very heavy, it still holds. So in the sense of mass system, this is P1, this is P2, and afterwards, this P1 changes sign, this P2 also changes sign. Okay, think a few times more about what I just said, until you feel that you really completely understood this.（如果一个粒子的质量非常小，而另一个非常重，这一关系仍然成立。在质量体系的视角下，这是P1，这是P2，随后P1变号，P2也随之变号。好了，把我刚才说的多思考几遍，直到你确信自己完全理解了这一点。）

And that should, if you are still a little bit hesitant, first think of the case where M1 is equal to M2. After you have thoroughly understood that, you will understand that it is also true even when M1 is not equal to M2. Now let us generalize that to two dimensions.（如果你仍然有些犹豫，不妨先考虑M1等于M2的情况。当你彻底理解这一点后，就会明白即使M1不等于M2，结论依然成立。现在让我们将其推广到二维情况。）

A two-dimensional elastic collision. The lesson is that you should go to the center of mass system, because everything looks similar in the center of mass system. The kinetic energy is equal to the energy of the center of mass system plus the energy in the center of mass system. The energy of the center of mass system is not changed. Whether elastic or inelastic, it is not changed. So the only possible change is in the energy in the center of mass system.（二维弹性碰撞。这个经验告诉我们，应该转换到质心系中，因为在质心系中一切看起来都很相似。动能等于质心的能量加上质心系中的能量。质心的能量不会改变。无论是弹性碰撞还是非弹性碰撞，它都不会改变。因此唯一可能的变化就是质心系中的能量。）

If it is elastic, then the energy in the center of mass system is not changed. So if you have two bodies in two dimensions, you have two bodies colliding. This is Vm, this is minus Vm. And afterwards, they can go in any direction now. They are not necessarily going this way. They can go this way. But the kinetic energy in the center of mass system is not changed if it is elastic. So if this is P1, this is minus P1. Afterwards, this is P1 prime.（如果是弹性碰撞，那么质心系中的能量不会改变。因此，如果有两个物体在二维空间中发生碰撞，假设这是Vm，这是负Vm。碰撞后，它们可以向任何方向运动，不一定沿着原来的路径。它们可以这样运动。但如果是弹性碰撞，质心系中的动能不会改变。所以如果这是P1，这是负P1。碰撞后，这是P1'。）

Now in the center of mass system, this is P2 prime. What can you conclude? P1 prime absolute value has to be equal to P1. P2 prime absolute value has to be equal to P2.
In other words, in the center of mass system, each body can change direction but not change speed. Two-dimensional elastic collision in the center of mass system, each particle can change direction but not speed. So you can have P1 minus P1, P1 prime minus P2 prime.（在质心系中，这是P2'。你能得出什么结论？P1'的绝对值必须等于P1，P2'的绝对值必须等于P2。换句话说，在质心系中，每个物体可以改变方向但不能改变速度。*质心系中的二维弹性碰撞，每个粒子可以改变方向但不能改变速度*。因此你可以得到P1减去P1，P1'减去P2'。）

But the P1 prime absolute value has to be equal to the origin of P1 absolute value. This is the kind of collision that in big laboratories, when people study the collision, let's say, between two protons. It's exactly where you have two protons colliding with each other. It could be elastic or not elastic. Sometimes it's elastic, sometimes it's inelastic. If it is elastic, the velocities are not changed in the center of mass system.（但P1的绝对主值必须等于P1绝对值的原点。这就是大型实验室中研究碰撞时的那种情况，比如两个质子之间的碰撞。这正是两个质子相互碰撞的地方。可能是弹性的，也可能是非弹性的。有时是弹性的，有时是非弹性的。如果是弹性的，在质心系中速度不会改变。 ）

Only the directions could change. And that's true if you collide a proton with a lambda, which do not have the same mass. Slowly, you have the same result. Namely, speed is not changed. And that's true, of course, also in three-dimensional, any dimension. Okay, if nobody has any problems, we'll move on to another topic.（唯一可能改变的是方向。如果你让一个质子和一个Λ粒子碰撞，情况也是如此，因为它们的质量不同。慢慢地，你会得到相同的结果。也就是说，速度并没有改变。当然，在三维空间或任何维度中，这一点也同样成立。好的，如果大家没有问题，我们就继续下一个话题。）

We'll move on to Chapter 11 and 12. Now the book, I'm not happy with the presentation of Chapters 11 and 12 in the book. So what I'm going to tell you now is more advanced than what's in the book. First, I want to prove a theorem. I'll read the theorem to you. In the motion of a rigid body with one fixed point, there is always a straight line through the fixed point which is not moved. If here's a body, a rigid body, and here's a point, oh, and suppose that point is not moved, and I now move the whole thing. So finally, let's say it goes this way. Then that point is not moved.（我们将继续讲解第11章和第12章的内容。不过，我对书中这两章的呈现方式并不满意。因此，接下来我要讲的内容会比书上的更深入一些。首先，我想证明一个定理。我来给大家读一下这个定理：在具有一个固定点的刚体运动中，总存在一条通过该固定点的直线是不动的。假设这里有一个刚体，这里有一个点，O，假设这个点是不动的，然后我现在移动整个物体。最终，比如说它移动到了这个方向。那么，这个点仍然是不动的。）

（接下来要讨论的内容是*欧拉旋转定理*：刚体绕一个固定点的任意运动都可以表示为绕通过该固定点的某个轴的旋转。）

What I want to prove is that there's, in fact, a whole straight line which is not moved through this point. Not only that point, but the whole line is not moved. If that is the case, that means that there is a rotation. The motion is a rotation through an angle, theta, around an axis. That line which is not moved is called the axis. And that rigid body now, not only is not moved relative to that point, O, it does not move along the whole line.（我想证明的是，实际上存在一整条直线在这个点处没有被移动。不仅是那个点，整条直线都没有移动。如果是这种情况，那就意味着存在一个旋转。这个运动是围绕一个轴旋转一个角度θ。那条未被移动的直线被称为轴。而现在这个刚体，不仅相对于那个点 O 没有移动，它沿着整条直线都没有移动。）

So the whole thing is a rotation. In other words, this theorem says, if a rigid body has one point fixed, there is motion, it's always a rotation around some axis. So this is what I next want to prove. This rule can go either geometrically or algebraically. So let's first prove this geometrically. Proof, geometrical proof.（所以整件事就是一个旋转。换句话说，这个定理说的是，如果一个刚体有一个固定点，有运动，它总是绕某个轴的旋转。这就是我接下来要证明的。这个规则可以从几何上或代数上来证明。所以我们先来从几何上证明它。证明，几何证明。）

Why do I always emphasize that there is a geometrical and an algebraic one? Because, in fact, either is correct, but you must know both. Because after you have known both, you understand the thing much better. So now let's first have the geometrical proof. First, let us not only talk about a point, but talk about a small sphere of, let's say, a diameter, a radius of one centimeter, around that point. Because that point always not changed, so that sphere is also not changed. So therefore, consider a sphere S centered around O. O is, I now consider a sphere.（为什么我总是强调既有几何证明又有代数证明？因为事实上两种方法都正确，但你必须掌握这两种方法。因为当你掌握了两种方法后，就能更深入地理解这个问题。所以现在我们先来看几何证明。首先，我们不要只讨论一个点，而是讨论围绕这个点的一个小球体，比如说直径为一厘米，半径为一厘米的球体。因为这个点始终不变，所以这个球体也不变。**因此，考虑一个以 O 为中心的球体 S。O 就是我现在考虑的球体的中心。**）

If that point is not changed, then that sphere, so S goes into S prime. So S prime is not changed. So now we don't have to think of a body. We think of just a general body. We just think of a sphere. So we have now a sphere S with a center. I now, like a billet ball, I now move it such that the center is not changed. What I wanted, so the sphere becomes S prime. I now want to prove that the difference between S prime and S is that it's just a rotation.（如果那个点不变，那么那个球体，即 S 变为 S'。因此 S' 没有变化。现在我们不必考虑一个具体的物体。我们只考虑一个一般的物体。我们只考虑一个球体。现在我们有一个带中心的球体S。现在，像一个台球一样，我移动它，但中心保持不变。我想要的是，球体变成 S'。现在我想证明S' 和 S 之间的区别仅仅是一个旋转。）

So here's a sphere, S. Let's consider a point A on it. After rotation, it becomes A prime. Consider a point A, it goes into A prime. So this is like the Earth. You have one point A, let's say Beijing. Beijing goes into, say, Taian. Now I draw a, I cut the line between A and A prime by a plane. Then you have a ball, from one end to the other. I cut a plane, bisect it, perpendicular bisect. Can anybody tell me what is this intersection, what is that called? It's called a great circle. It's like a 赤道. What is it called in Chinese? Great circle.（这里有一个球体，S。我们**考虑球面上的一个点 A。旋转后，它变成了 A'**。考虑一个点 A，它移动到 A'。这就像地球一样。你有一个点 A，比如说北京。北京移动到了，比如说，泰安。现在我画一个，我用一个平面切割 A 和 A' 之间的连线。然后你有一个球体，从一端到另一端。我切割一个平面，将其平分，垂直平分。有人能告诉我这个交线叫什么吗？它被称为大圆。就像一条赤道。中文里叫什么？大圆。）

Is it called a great circle? So A is here, Beijing is here, Taian is here. I cut a line like this, and it becomes a great circle on the Earth. The plane that bisects A, A prime, and perpendicular to it, intersects the surface of S in a great circle. We call it circle 1. OK. Then I draw another one, B. B goes to B prime. Then I do the same thing, B and B prime. Then I get another great circle. So I have two great circles. These two great circles intersect at a point.(这叫大圆吗？那么 A 在这里，北京在这里，泰安在这里。我这样画一条线，在地球上就形成了一个大圆。平分 A和 A' 并与之垂直的平面，与球面 S 相交形成一个大圆。我们称之为圆 1。好的。**然后我再画一个，B。B 到 B'。然后我做同样的事情，B 和 B'。然后我又得到了一个大圆。所以我有两个大圆。这两个大圆在某一点相交。**)

This point is called N. Now consider B dot B prime. Then I draw another circle, C2. Another great circle. Let N be one of the intersections of C1 and C2. C1 and C2 are two great circles. Two great circles must have two intersections. They are diametrically opposite. I just randomly pick one, which is called N. So we have three points. A, B, and N. So A, B, N forms a triangle. A prime, B prime, N forms a triangle. Now, the distance between AN and BN. Now, AN. N lies on this big circle. This big circle bisects AN and A prime. Does everybody agree that the distance AN is equal to the distance A prime N? If you look at the diagram, you will see it clearly.(这一点称为 N。现在考虑点 B 到 B'。然后我再画另一个大圆C2。C1和C2是两个大圆。两个大圆必定有两个交点，这两个交点是对径点。我随机选取其中一个交点，称为N。这样我们就有三个点：A、B和N。因此A、B、N构成一个三角形，A'、B'、N也构成一个三角形。现在来看AN和BN的距离。由于N位于这个大圆上，这个大圆将AN和A'N平分。大家都同意AN的距离等于A'N的距离吗？如果看图的话会很清楚。)

So we know distance AN is equal to A prime N. For the same reason, the distance BN is equal to B prime N. This is the same construction. Because N lies on the first big circle and the second big circle. So the distance to B and B prime is the same. Of course, AB is equal to AB prime because of the rotation. A and B are two points on the sphere. It's rotated to A prime, B prime, so the distance cannot change. It's a rigid body. So now we have two triangles. The three sides of the first triangle is equal to the three sides of the next triangle.
So therefore, it's the same. In other words, the triangle ABN and triangle A prime B prime N is the same. All the angles are the same.（因此我们知道**距离AN等于A'N**。同理，**距离BN等于B'N**。这是相同的构造。因为N位于第一个大圆和第二个大圆上。所以到B和B'的距离是相同的。当然，**由于旋转，AB等于A‘B'。A和B是球面上的两点。它们旋转到A'和B'，所以距离不会改变**。这是一个刚体。所以现在我们有两个三角形。第一个三角形的三条边等于第二个三角形的三条边。因此，它们是相同的。换句话说，三角形ABN和三角形A'B'N是相同的。所有角度都相同。）

![[Pasted image 20251008224420.png|200]]
Now, assume that N is also a point on the sphere. So in the motion, it goes to a new point. And let's call it N prime. I now want to prove that M prime has to be equal to N. That means that that point is not moved. ABN, A prime, B prime, M prime is equal to, is ABN moved? By definition, A is moved to A prime. B is moved to B prime. A is moved to M prime. So ABN is moved to A prime, B prime, M prime. That's the definition. So now I just think. I have now, similarly, AB, A prime, B prime, N is ABN moved. We just said A prime, B prime, M prime is ABN moved.（现在，假设 N 也是球面上的一个点。因此，在运动中，它会移动到一个新的位置。我们称这个新位置为 N'。现在我想证明 N'必须等于 N。这意味着那个点没有被移动。A'B'N' 等于 ABN 被移动了吗？根据定义，A 被移动到了 A'，B 被移动到了 B'，N 被移动到了 N'。所以 ABN 被移动到了 A'B'N'。这就是定义。现在，我只需要思考。同样地，A'B'N 是 ABN 移动后的结果。我们刚刚说过 A'B'N' 是 ABN 移动后的结果。）

But we just said a few minutes earlier that ABN and A prime, B prime, N are the same. So therefore, it's also ABN moved. You compare these two. A prime, B prime, M prime is the same as A prime, B prime, N. So therefore, N is equal to N prime. So in theory, A prime is fixed, B prime is also fixed. A prime, B prime, N. A prime, B prime, N prime. They are all the same triangle. So the point must be the same. So we have proved that not only is the point O not moved, but we have found a point N which is not moved. So the whole line ON is not moved. i.e. ON is not moved. It is the axis.（但我们刚刚才说过，ABN 和 A'B'N 是相同的。因此，A'B'N 也是 ABN 移动的结果。你比较这两个。A'B'N' 和 A'B'N 是相同的。因此，N 等于 N'。所以理论上，A'是固定的，B'也是固定的。A'B'N、A'B'N'，它们都是同一个三角形。所以这个点必须是相同的。因此，我们不仅证明了点 O 没有移动，而且还找到了一个没有移动的点 N。所以整条线 ON 都没有移动。也就是说，ON 没有移动。它就是轴线。）

Is everybody happy? This proof is actually very simple. Go back and think about it. So what have we proved? We have proved that if a rigid body has one point fixed, then whatever its motion is, it's always a rotation. Around some axis. So now, instantaneous angular velocity. Now I want to introduce the concept of instantaneous angular velocity. In a body, we consider a rigid body which has one point fixed O. So we have a body, let's say X goes to X prime. This motion is by a... There's an axis. And there's another axis, of course.（大家都开心吗？这个证明其实很简单。回过头来想一想。那么我们证明了什么呢？我们已经证明，如果一个刚体有一个固定点，那么无论它的运动如何，它始终是一个旋转。围绕某个轴。所以现在，瞬时角速度。现在我想引入瞬时角速度的概念。在一个物体中，我们考虑一个有一个固定点 O 的刚体。所以我们有一个物体，比如说 X 到  X'。这个运动是通过一个...有一个轴。这当然有一个轴。）

You have an angle of rotation, theta. So delta theta. If that motion goes through a time, delta t, that is equal to the average angular velocity. Just like a linear velocity. Now I move. Now I consider a smaller and smaller delta t. Just like our definition of the instantaneous linear velocity. So I'm considering, for example, a rotation, a shorter interval of delta t. So it will be in between X and X prime. But that still is a rotation. That rotation may be along a slightly different axis as this one.（你有一个旋转角度 θ，即 Δθ。如果这个运动经历的时间为 Δt，那么它就等于平均角速度，就像线速度一样。现在我移动了。现在考虑越来越小的 Δt，就像我们对瞬时线速度的定义一样。例如，我正在考虑一个旋转，一个更短的 Δt 间隔。因此，它会在 X 和 X' 之间。但这仍然是一个旋转。这个旋转的轴线可能与这个旋转的轴线略有不同。）

But that's not so strange. In linear velocity, when you define it, there is the direction where we define. In delta t, it moves from this point to this point. In half of it, delta t moves from here. So the direction of the velocity is changed. It continuously changes. Eventually, when delta t is very small, it goes into the tangent. What I want to say is that for linear motion, the direction of the displacement changes as delta t becomes smaller and smaller. Eventually, it approaches a fixed point.（但这并不奇怪。在线速度的定义中，方向是我们所规定的。在 Δt 时间内，物体从这一点移动到另一点。而在 Δt 的一半时间内，位移则从这里开始。因此，速度的方向发生了改变，且持续变化。最终，当 Δt 非常小时，速度方向趋近于切线方向。我想说的是，对于线性运动，位移的方向会随着 Δt 越来越小而不断变化，最终趋近于一个固定点。）

Similarly here, if I take a delta t, it's a rotation. If I take half of a delta t, it is also a rotation, but the rotation direction, the axis may be slightly changed. However, when delta t goes to zero, it becomes a limited direction. Just like here, there's a limited direction. So a limit of delta theta over delta t, as delta t goes to zero, that's called instantaneous angular velocity. But it not only has a magnitude, it also has a direction.（同样地，在这里，如果我取一个 Δt，它是一个旋转。如果我取 Δt 的一半，它也是一个旋转，但旋转的方向，轴可能会略有变化。然而，当 Δt 趋近于零时，它就变成了一个固定的方向。就像这里，有一个固定的方向。因此，当 Δt 趋近于零时，Δθ 除以 Δt 的极限，被称为瞬时角速度。但它不仅有大小，还有方向。）

In other words, I said that when you take t, delta t, it's a rotation like this with an axis. Because of what we just proved, it has an axis. If you take half of a delta t, the axis would be slightly different, just like a linear motion. Eventually, when delta t goes to zero, it goes into some direction. So this instantaneous angular velocity not only has a magnitude, but it also has a direction. It's called omega. So this is a vector definition of angular velocity. Omega is a vector. This is the most important thing.(换句话说，我刚才说的是，当你取时间增量 Δt 时，它就是一个绕轴旋转的运动。根据我们刚才证明的结论，这个旋转必然存在一个旋转轴。如果取 Δt 的一半，旋转轴会略有不同，就像直线运动一样。最终当 Δt 趋近于零时，旋转会趋向某个特定方向。因此这个瞬时角速度不仅具有大小，还具有方向。我们称之为 ω。这就是角速度的矢量定义——ω是一个矢量，这是最关键的一点。)

And it's not intuitively immediately clear. But you have to be familiar with it. If a body rotates, it has a... This omega has a magnitude which is defined this way, through the limit.
It has a direction which is the direction of the axis, the limiting direction. But let's say it's not complete because the limiting direction has two directions. It can go this way, it can go the other way. And we define it as a right-handed one. In the definition, we choose the right-handed system. There's an axis, the axis can go either way.(这并非直观上立刻就能明白的。但你必须熟悉它。如果一个物体旋转，它有一个...这个ω有一个大小，是通过极限这样定义的。它有一个方向，就是轴的方向，极限方向。但可以说这还不完整，因为极限方向有两个方向。可以是这个方向，也可以是另一个方向。我们将其定义为右手方向。在定义中，我们选择右手系。有一个轴，轴可以朝任意方向。)

But we define it such that if the rotation is this way, we define it to be that way. Because that's called a right-handed system. Everybody happy with what I just discussed? So if a rigid body is fixed, it moves with time. Then at each instant, it is a rotation with an angular velocity, which is a vector. And that vector is along the direction of, it's not moving, but it's a rotation around it. Now next I want to ask, what is the velocity of every point? Of every point in the body, in the rigid body.(但我们这样定义：如果旋转是这个方向，我们就定义为那个方向。因为那被称为右手坐标系。大家对我刚才讨论的内容都清楚了吗？所以如果一个刚体是固定的，它会随时间移动。那么在每一瞬间，它都是以一个角速度进行旋转，这个角速度是一个矢量。这个矢量沿着某个方向，刚体本身没有移动，而是绕着这个方向旋转。接下来我想问的是，每个点的速度是多少？刚体中每个点的速度。)

What is the velocity of every point in the body? The fundamental formula is take the point O, digital omega. O is the fixed point. And we have just defined the angular velocity omega.
Now I consider a point R is a rotation. Take a plane at every point. This is the fixed O. And take R and go around in a circle around the axis omega. You draw the circle, this is the center of the circle. What is the velocity of the point? The point I claim is the V. The R of the point, this is a rigid body. It is rotated.(物体中每一点的速度是多少？基本公式是以点 O 为基准，角速度 ω。O 是固定点。我们刚刚定义了角速度 ω。现在我考虑一个点 R 在旋转。在每一点取一个平面。这是固定的 O。取 R 点，绕 ω 轴做圆周运动。画出这个圆，这是圆心。该点的速度是多少？我声称该点的速度为 V。点 R 的位置，这是一个刚体。它在旋转。)

$$\vec{v}=\vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}$$
方向就是切线方向，大小为 $\omega r \sin \theta$

Targeted is equal to omega cross R. First, the direction. The direction of this point, the direction of motion of this point is the tangent of that circle. And that's exactly the direction of omega cross R. Because omega cross R is perpendicular to the omega OR plane. And therefore, omega cross R is in the direction of the tangent to that circle. And that's of course the direction of the velocity. The magnitude of the velocity of this point is equal to this distance, which is R sine theta.(目标等于ω叉乘R。首先来看方向。该点的运动方向就是该圆的切线方向，而这正是ω叉乘R的方向。因为ω叉乘R垂直于ω或R所在的平面。因此，ω叉乘R的方向与该圆的切线方向一致，而这当然也是速度的方向。该点速度的大小等于这段距离，即R乘以sinθ。)

And that's precisely what is in the definition of a cross product. You remember that we had the definition of a cross product, omega cross R. In that definition, it's the magnitude of R times the magnitude of omega times sine theta. And that's exactly because sine theta times R is exactly this distance. And that distance times the delta omega divided by delta t precisely gives you the velocity. So we have this formula. You have to understand this so that it becomes a part of your system.(而这正是叉积定义的核心所在。还记得我们定义叉积ω×R时，其大小等于R的模乘以ω的模再乘以sinθ。正是因为sinθ乘以R恰好等于这个垂直距离，这个公式必须深入理解，让它成为你知识体系的一部分。)

If you use it instantaneously, you would remember this. So let's see what we have learned. What we have learned is that if a rigid body moves with one point not fixed, one point not moving, one point fixed, then it has an omega. It has a vector angular velocity. And once you know that omega, you know the motion of the velocity of every point in the body. Now what happens if it's a general motion? General motion of a rigid body.  So you have a body here and it moves to here. I take one point here. So the whole thing is moving and it's rotating.（如果你立刻使用它，你会记住这一点。那么让我们看看我们学到了什么。我们学到的是，如果一个刚体运动时有一点不动，有一点固定，那么它就有一个角速度 ω。它有一个矢量角速度。一旦你知道了这个 ω，你就知道了体内每一点的运动速度。那么如果是普遍运动呢？刚体的普遍运动。假设这里有一个物体，它移动到这里。我在这里取一点。所以整个物体在移动，同时也在旋转。）

It's obvious that that motion is equivalent to a movement of O to O. You can take any point O. Suppose it moves to O prime. So you decompose the motion into motion O into O prime and the rotation around O. So general motion of a rigid body is equal to a motion of one point to any point followed by a rotation. That point O is arbitrary, but it's the most convenient if we take it to be the center of mass.（显然，该运动等同于从 O 点到 O 点的移动。你可以选择任意一点 O。假设它移动到 O'。那么你可以将运动分解为从 O 到 O' 的移动和围绕 O 点的旋转。因此，刚体的一般运动等于从一个点到任意一点的移动，随后再进行旋转。点 O 是任意的，但如果我们选择它作为质心，将是最方便的。）

So we usually think of the motion of a rigid body to be the motion of its center of mass plus an omega around the center of mass. That means we have, in general, a velocity of the center of mass and an omega around the center of mass. So the motion of a rigid body is now specified by two vectors. And the velocity of that 任何一个 point is equal to the velocity of the center of mass Plus omega cross r. R is a vector position of the point relative to center of mass. （因此，我们通常认为刚体的运动是其质心的运动加上绕质心的角速度。这意味着，我们通常有一个质心的速度和绕质心的角速度。因此，刚体的运动现在由两个向量来指定。而任何一个点的速度等于质心的速度加上omega叉乘r。R 是点相对于质心的位置矢量。）

$$\vec{v}=\vec{v}_{\text{com}} + \vec{\omega} \times\vec{r}$$
$\vec{r}$ 是点相对于质心的位置矢量。


What we have just discussed is a very important thing.
We resolve the motion of a rigid body into two vectors. And this formula gives you the instantaneous velocity of every point on the rigid body. We have given a geometrical proof.
The key point of the geometrical proof is to show that in a rigid rotation where one point is not moved, there is always a whole axis which is not moved. We can show this also algebraically. To do this, we need some matrix theory.
It's linear algebra. How many people have learned some linear algebra so far? Nobody? How many people have not learned linear algebra? Zero plus zero cannot be equal to one. So something is wrong.
Don't be bashful. Oh, is everybody studying linear algebra now? Oh, and have you learned the matrix multiplication? OK. OK, let's let's go through that once more.
I can write the coordinate X, Y, Z as a column. And let's call it R. Instead of the vector R, I now form it into a matrix. And I have a tilde.
Tilde is to turn the matrix and turn this red column into a row. So tilde is equal to. So a matrix which is like this.
After you do the tilde, it becomes like this. You take this 45 degree and rotate it in this form. So what is R tilde R? R tilde R is X, Y, Z times X, Y, Z. When you multiply two matrices, you just take this column and multiply this.
So it becomes X square plus Y square plus Z square. Now, let us write IJK. Let us give it an arbitrary symbol.
Let's call it X. Now, XR is therefore equal to XI plus YJ plus ZK. By definition, when I multiply an X, the R here, we can have the arrow. We don't need the arrows.
It doesn't matter whether you write an arrow over it. This is a row. This is a column.
So it's like this. Now, let us rotate the coordinate system. Call that X prime.
So I've already done IJK. I've rotated the coordinate system. I shall call it I prime, J prime, K prime.
And I write this as a row matrix, X prime. Now, X prime, R prime is equal to X prime, I prime, plus Y prime, J prime, plus Z prime, K prime. And so this is the coordinate.
This describes the point. This describes the same point. So therefore, they have to be the same.
So X prime, R prime is equal to XR. That means the relationship between X prime and X and also the relationship between R prime and R are linear. So I was a column is equal to a matrix which has a gamma times R. This gamma is a is a three by three matrix.
And this is this is all this is all fine. I'm not going to erase this. It's especially if we do it the other way.
X prime is equal to I prime, J prime, K prime. Now, I prime is a linear combination of IJK and J prime. J prime is the new y-axis.
It's a linear combination of the i, j, k. K prime is a linear combination of i, j, k. So therefore, x prime is equal to x times the matrix gamma. This is a row. This is a row.
This is a column. There are nine elements of gamma. Each element is the coefficient in the expression of i prime or j prime or k prime in terms of i, j, k. If I substitute that into here, I get gamma.
Therefore, if I multiply this by the inverse, how do I know that gamma has an inverse? I'll come to that in one minute. If I multiply both sides by gamma inverse, I get r prime equal to gamma inverse r. We couldn't define gamma inverse by this formula. In other words, r prime is x prime, y prime, z prime.
x prime, y prime, z prime are linear combinations of x, y, z. And so it has the nine coefficients, and the nine coefficients is gamma inverse. Now, we know that r prime, that by definition is x prime squared plus y prime squared plus z prime squared. And that's clearly equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared, because that's the distance squared from the origin.
So this is equal to r. Now, I plug that formula in. Therefore, this side. Now, when you take a wiggle of A, B, does anybody know how to take? A is a matrix.
This is more general than what we just looked at. Suppose I have, when you multiply two matrices together, A and B, they can both be rectangular of whatever size, but there's one thing that must match. Namely, the width of the first one must be equal to the height of the second one.
Otherwise, you cannot multiply them. Because when you multiply, you always take, let's say there are three elements here. Let's call them alpha, beta, gamma.
And this is A, B, C. There is alpha A plus beta B plus gamma C. So this width must be equal to this height. But after you multiply it, otherwise there's no restriction. And the result of this has the height of this one and the width of this one.
When you multiply A and B, the final result has a height, which is the height of A, has a width, which is the width of B. And there's a formula of A, when you turn it into a tilde, the theorem is that this is a trivial theorem. It's equal to B tilde times A tilde. But you have to, you have to write the order differently.
Does everybody know this theorem? Okay. So this becomes R tilde, gamma inverse tilde, gamma inverse R is equal to R, R. Now let's look at this. Both sides are R and R at the end.
And there's something in the middle. This is a three by three matrix. So this is, this is, and this is nothing but the X squared plus Y squared plus Z squared.
And here is X, Y, Z. Here is X, Y, Z. And if you think about it for a few minutes, you immediately know that this has to be equal to one. So the conclusion is that one is one, one, one. You think of this, this one, if I sandwich it between R tilde and R, I get exactly X squared plus Y squared plus Z squared.
You may object. You say that it does not yet follow from here that that is equal to one. Because what happens if these two elements are equal and opposite? If these two elements are equal and opposite, this formula still holds.
But you know that this is a symmetrical matrix. How do I know it's a symmetrical? I tell it. There's a footnote.
The tilde of this, by this rule, is equal to, the tilde of the tilde is equal to itself. Because we tell it twice. So that means this thing, after we tell it, it comes back to itself.
So that means that the matrix is symmetrical. If it's a symmetrical matrix, you cannot have these two opposite. So therefore, we have this.
This is a footnote to prevent the objection that maybe it's a one here and minus one here. You can't be because it has to be a symmetric matrix. So that's the most important statement.
If a matrix is equal to one, its inverse is also equal to one, so I can take the inverse. When you take the inverse, the inverse of AB is equal to the inverse of B times the inverse of A, again reversed order. So if I take the inverse of this, I get gamma and gamma tilde is equal to one.
So such a matrix is called an orthogonal matrix. Furthermore, the determinant of gamma is one.
