#### 书籍推荐

总的原则是看一些比较现实的，已经被论证出来的东西，年轻学者，不要被一些空洞的东西所吸引，从一开始就走上一些缥缈的路线。后续在第五讲中还提到了霍金的《时间简史》一类的书籍，相信很多人都看过或听过，这实际上是不被推荐的。

I hope you have no difficulties with your exercises. I distributed a new syllabus. I want to remind you of two things. First, it says material not covered by the book will not be included in the midterm nor in the final. In this way, you can feel more comfortable. Also, at the bottom of this page, I wrote something about some books that I would recommend.（希望你在做练习时没有遇到困难。我分发了一份新的教学大纲。我想提醒你两件事。首先，大纲中提到书本未涵盖的内容不会出现在期中或期末考试中。这样你可以更放心。另外，在这页底部，我推荐了一些书籍的相关信息。）

I recommend a book by James Jeans called The Mysterious Universe. I think it's translated in Chinese. The reason I'm telling you this is because last week, a student came to me and said that he read a book that he didn't understand. The book he showed me was called Green. It's a relatively new book. I told him not to read this kind of book. Because if you ask me, I think this kind of book is inhumane. Because what it talks about is Green. Green is a professor at Columbia University.（我推荐一本詹姆斯·金斯写的书，叫《神秘的宇宙》。我想它应该有中文译本。我之所以告诉你这个，是因为上周有个学生来找我，说他读了一本看不懂的书。他给我看的书名叫 Green。这是一本比较新的书。我告诉他不要读这种书。因为在我看来，我觉得这种书是不好的。因为它讲的是 Green。Green 是哥伦比亚大学的一位教授。）

《神秘的宇宙》这本书，年代比较久远，我找过中文版本的，是繁体中文的，说实话读起来无论是繁体字本身上的阅读体验还是内容话术表达上，总觉得怪怪的，读不通顺，阅读体验不佳，也可能是我自己的问题。如果有需要的话可留言，后面会分享出来。

I think he is in his forties or fifties. The direction he is going is what many young people are doing now. But this direction is now a hollow. It hasn't been implemented, and it's unlikely to be implemented in the future. But if a young person doesn't know this, I think the most likely phenomenon is that he is attracted to an unstable direction. This is very bad.（我认为他四五十岁。他走的方向是现在很多年轻人正在做的。但这个方向现在是个空洞。它还没有被落实，未来也不太可能被落实。但如果一个年轻人不知道这一点，我认为最可能出现的现象是他被一个不稳定的方向所吸引。这非常糟糕。）

James Jeans is a great astrophysicist in the early 20th century. What is described in this book concerns the great revolutions of the beginning of the 20th century, namely special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. At the time that Jeans wrote the book, these were already revolutions which have materialized. They have materialized. These were revolutions that affected the history of mankind. This is completely different from the hollow.（詹姆斯·金斯是 20 世纪初一位伟大的天体物理学家。这本书所描述的，正是 20 世纪初那几场伟大的革命——狭义相对论、广义相对论和量子力学。当金斯撰写这本书时，这些革命已经成为现实。它们已经实现了。这些是影响了人类历史的革命。这与空洞的东西完全不同。）

So when you read these books, you should have a choice. The other journal that I recommend is the Scientific American. The Scientific American is now translated into Chinese. You could read either the Chinese version or the English version. The Scientific American would have articles about the kind of thing that Mr. Green writes about. But most of it concerns more realistic research.（所以当你阅读这些书籍时，你应该有所选择。我推荐的另一本期刊是《科学美国人》。《科学美国人》现在已经有中文译本了。你可以阅读中文版或英文版。《科学美国人》会刊登格林先生所写的那类文章。但其中大部分内容涉及更现实的研究。）

Much of it concerns biology, for example. I highly recommend this to you for the following reason. The educational system in China tends to make students concentrated and just go into one direction. The educational system, especially in America, is the opposite. It has a tendency to want students to learn a lot of things. Both of them have advantages and disadvantages.（例如，其中很多内容与生物学有关。我强烈推荐你阅读这本书，原因如下：中国的教育体系往往让学生专注于单一方向，而美国的教育体系则恰恰相反，倾向于让学生广泛涉猎各种知识。两者各有利弊。）

But because you have been educated under the Chinese educational system, so you should perhaps absorb some of the advantages of the other system. So if you broaden your horizons, it's good. If you start to read Scientific American, you will find that many of the articles you have difficulty understanding.Don't worry about that. Just keep on reading it. And after you have read it for half a year, you would realize that many of the things that you at first did not understand, you now understand much better. And this is a way to learn. （但由于你是在中国教育体系下接受教育的，所以也许你应该吸收其他体系的一些优点。因此，开阔视野对你有好处。如果你开始阅读《科学美国人》，你会发现很多文章难以理解。别担心。继续读下去就好。等你读了半年之后，你就会发现很多一开始不理解的东西，现在理解得更好了。这就是学习的方法。）

Okay. Because I have some appointment this afternoon, so this afternoon's consultation period from 4 to 5 is canceled. But I shall schedule it for tomorrow. But just for this week. This week will be changed to Tuesday. （好的。因为我今天下午有个会，所以下午 4 点到 5 点的咨询时间取消了。但我明天会安排。但这周仅此一次。这周将改到周二。）

## 第四章：二维或三维空间的运动

#### 位移、（平均/瞬时）速度、（平均/瞬时）加速度

Okay. Let's talk about the fourth chapter. The fourth chapter is we discuss motions in two dimensions or three dimensions. It's actually very similar to the problems of motion in one dimension. First, if you have a body which is moving in two dimensions like this, from this point to this point, there's a displacement. So there's a displacement which is a vector.（好的。我们来讨论第四章。第四章讲的是二维或三维空间中的运动。实际上，这与一维运动的问题非常相似。首先，如果一个物体像这样在二维空间中移动，从这个点到那个点，就会有一个位移。所以位移是一个矢量。）

The coordinate of a particle would be designated by R. It's a vector. And three dimensions is a three dimensional vector starting from some origin. So from this point to this point of the average velocity, average velocity is equal to the displacement divided by a student. The displacement is a three dimensional vector. So this velocity is also a three dimensional effect. We can express R like this.（粒子的坐标用 $\vec{r}$ 表示。它是一个矢量。在三维空间中，这是一个从某个原点出发的三维矢量。因此，从这一点到这一点，平均速度等于位移除以时间。位移是一个三维矢量。所以这个速度也是一个三维矢量。我们可以这样表示R。）

$$\text{平均速度}=\frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}$$

Oh, you can write it as X, I plus Y, J plus Z, K. Well, IJK are the three unit vectors along the X axis, Y axis and Z axis. A right handed system. After we have the definition of the average velocity, we can have an instantaneous velocity. Namely, we make this delta t smaller and smaller. Now, I am going to draw a larger diagram. If delta t is this, the displacement is in this direction, so the average velocity is also in this direction.(哦，你可以写成X乘以I，加上Y乘以J，再加上Z乘以K。这里的 IJK 就是沿着 X 轴、Y 轴和 Z 轴的三个单位向量，构成一个右手坐标系。定义好平均速度后，我们就能得到瞬时速度。也就是说，我们让这个 Δt 越来越小。现在，我要画一个更大的示意图。如果 Δt 是这个，位移就在这个方向上，那么平均速度也是这个方向。 )

$$\vec{r}=(x,y,z)= x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}$$

It's equal to this vector divided by delta t. Now, if I take a smaller delta t, I may be going this way. So this divided by the smaller delta t is the average velocity during this shorter period. If I now shrink delta t to zero, which direction would be the average velocity? Obviously, it would become along the tangent direction.(它等于这个向量除以 Δt。现在，如果我取一个更小的 Δt，我可能会朝这个方向移动。因此，这个除以更小的 Δt 就是在更短时间内的平均速度。如果我现在将 Δt 缩小到零，平均速度会朝哪个方向？显然，它会沿着切线方向。)

So we have the idea of instantaneous velocity. And that's equal to the limit of delta r over delta t as delta t goes to zero. That's the definition of the instantaneous velocity. Usually that's just called velocity. Delta r, as delta t goes to zero, delta r becomes smaller and smaller. But delta t also becomes smaller and smaller.(于是我们有了瞬时速度的概念。它等于当 Δt 趋近于零时 Δr 与 Δt 比值的极限。这就是瞬时速度的定义。通常简称为速度。当 Δt 趋近于零时，Δr 会变得越来越小，但 Δt 也同样会变得越来越小。)

$$\text{瞬时速度 } \vec{v}=\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{r}}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

So the ratio delta r over delta t approaches a finite number. And that's what the—so this is the velocity. This is exactly similar to what we have discussed last time about motion in one dimension. There is very little difference. It's just that we write it as a three-dimensional vector. Of course, with this, we now have also the concept of average acceleration.(因此，比率 Δr/Δt 趋近于一个有限数。这就是——所以这就是速度。这与我们上次讨论的一维运动非常相似。几乎没有区别。只是我们把它写成了一个三维矢量。当然，有了这个，我们现在也有了平均加速度的概念。)

Just a second. This, by definition, is equal to the derivative of r with respect to t. Such a limit is a derivative. The instantaneous acceleration is equal to the next derivative. We shall have an explicit example of what this acceleration is. (稍等。根据定义，这等于r对t的导数。这个极限就是一个导数。瞬时加速度等于下一个导数。我们将有一个明确的例子来说明这个加速度是什么。)

$$\text{瞬时加速度 } \vec{a} = \lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \vec{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^2}$$

#### 抛体运动

Next, we talk about projectile motion. Projectile. By definition, the acceleration, instantaneous acceleration is equal to d squared r dt squared. So I take this r and take the derivative. So I get d squared x dt squared i plus d squared y dt squared j plus d squared z dt squared k. In other words, the three components of the acceleration are separately calculated.(接下来，我们讨论抛体运动。抛体。根据定义，加速度，即瞬时加速度等于d²r/dt²。因此，我取这个r并求导。于是得到d²x/dt² i + d²y/dt² j + d²z/dt² k。换句话说，加速度的三个分量是分别计算的。)

$$\text{抛体运动：}\vec{a}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \vec{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\hat{i} + \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \vec{y}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \hat{j}+\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \vec{z}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \hat{k}=-g \hat{k}$$

The x component of the acceleration only relates to x as a function of t. x is a function of t. So a projectile comes out. Suppose this is x-axis, this is z-axis, this is x-axis, this is y-axis. The x-axis motion, x as a function of t, has nothing to do with y as a function of t or z as a function of t. So what is the characteristic of a projectile motion? The three components of the acceleration, only z-axis has acceleration.(加速度的x分量仅与x作为t的函数相关。x是t的函数。于是抛体运动就出现了。假设这是x轴，这是z轴，这是x轴，这是y轴。x轴方向的运动，即x作为t的函数，与y作为t的函数或z作为t的函数无关。那么抛体运动的特点是什么？*加速度的三个分量中，只有 z 轴方向存在加速度。*)

The x-axis and y-axis have no acceleration. Only the z-axis has acceleration. So the definition of projectile motion can be said that this quantity is equal to negative g. It is equal to a negative g multiplied by a unit vector in the z-direction.(x 轴和 y 轴没有加速度。只有 z 轴有加速度。因此，抛体运动的定义可以说这个量等于 $-g$。它等于 $-g$ 乘以 z 方向的单位向量。)

Multiplied by a negative g. The reason for the negative g is that we always take z-axis to go upwards. So what does this represent? This represents d squared x dt is equal to zero. d squared y dt, d squared z. In other words, the x-axis is a motion without acceleration.The y-axis is the same. The z-axis is a motion with uniform acceleration. d squared x dt squared represents that the x-axis motion has no acceleration.It represents dx dt. (乘以 $-g$ 的原因是我们总是将 z 轴朝上。那么这代表什么呢？这表示 d²x/dt² 等于零。d²y/dt²，d²z/dt²。换句话说，x 轴上的运动没有加速度。y 轴也没有加速度。z 轴是匀加速运动。d²x/dt²表示x轴运动没有加速度。它代表dx/dt。）

The acceleration in the x-direction is zero. It means that there is no acceleration. No acceleration means that it is a uniform velocity. So dx dt is equal to a constant. Constant means that it is a constant. At this time, we can write it as x vx zero. It means that the velocity in the x-axis is zero. The velocity when t is equal to zero. Similarly, dy dt is equal to vy zero. The acceleration of the z-axis is negative g. It means that every unit of time increases the velocity of the z-axis by negative g. So dz dt is equal to negative g times t plus vz. With this formula, you see that the z-axis z-axis velocity increases by minus g every unit of t. So the first line gives you the acceleration.（x方向的加速度为零。这意味着没有加速度。没有加速度意味着它是匀速运动。因此 dx/dt 等于一个常数。常数意味着它是一个恒量。此时，我们可以将其写作 $(v_x)_{0}$。即 t 等于零时的速度。同理，dy/dt等于 $(v_{y})_{0}$。z 轴的加速度为 $-g$，表示每单位时间 z 轴速度增加 -g。因此，dz/dt 等于 -gt。通过这个公式可以看出，z轴速度每单位时间t增加负g。所以第一行给出的是加速度。）

$$\text{分量加速度：}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0；\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0；\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 z}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-g$$
$$分量速度：\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=(v_{x})_{0};\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}=(v_{y})_{0};\quad \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}=(v_{z})_{0}-gt$$
$$\text{分量位移：}x=(v_{x})_{0}t+x_{0};\quad y=(v_{y})_{0}t+y_{0}; \quad z=(v_{z})_{0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+z_{0}$$

It's zero zero minus g. The second line gives you the these three lines gives you the velocity. If the velocity is this. So we now know what is x. Similarly, you get v x zero t plus x zero y is equal to v y zero t plus y zero z. Now, the emotion is a uniform acceleration.(这是零减g。第二行给出了这三行给出了速度。如果速度是这个。那么我们现在知道x是什么了。同样地，你得到vx零t加x零y等于vy零t加y零z。现在，运动是一个匀加速运动。)

Uniform acceleration. We had the formula before. So this is equal to v z zero t minus one half g t squared plus zero. We have this formula for uniform motion. For example, if we start from this point, if the particle has a v x zero v z zero. So suppose there is no motion in the y axis. So it's a planar motion. You can communicate the motion. Then it's obvious that it will go.(匀加速运动。我们之前已经推导过这个公式。因此这个表达式等于vz0t减去1/2gt²再加上z0。我们得到了这个匀加速运动公式。举例来说，如果我们从这个点出发，假设粒子具有初速度vx0和vz0。同时假设y轴方向没有运动，那么这就是一个平面运动。你可以这样描述这个运动轨迹。显然粒子将会沿着这样的路径运动。)

This gives you a parametric representation. You know, time for the representation. I'm sure in high school you have learned this. And you get time for with the t. This is linear. This is quadratic. So this curve is a quadratic curve. It's a parabola. You're going to show the parabola. You win the parabola. The name parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola. This and this and don't share. You're going home.(这给出了一个参数表示。你知道的，是时候展示这个表示了。我相信你在高中就学过这个。然后你用 t 来表示时间。这是线性的。这是二次的。所以这条曲线是二次曲线。这是一条抛物线。抛物线、椭圆、双曲线，这些都是圆锥曲线)

In great detail by the Greeks. And so Greek geometry was one of the great achievements. And one of the reasons that the modern science did not originate in China.One of, there are many reasons, but one of the most important reason was that in ancient China, people only studied algebra essentially, never developed geometry. If you read the Greek ancient works on geometry, you must admire how much detail, how much time they had spent on geometry, and how much they have understood the conic sections. （希腊人对此进行了极其详尽的阐述。因此，希腊几何学是伟大的成就之一。这也是现代科学未起源于中国的原因之一。原因有很多，但最重要的原因之一是，在古代中国，人们主要研究代数，从未发展几何学。如果你读过古希腊关于几何学的著作，你一定会惊叹于他们对几何学投入了多少细节和时间，以及他们对圆锥曲线的理解有多深。）

We had in the last page the following formula. d square z, dz dt is equal to v. The way we obtained this formula. We start from this and obtain this formula. Remember how we did that the last time. We said that if there is a velocity which is equal to this, and it's a uniform acceleration, then we first calculate an average velocity for an interval. We take the velocity at the beginning and the velocity at the end and took the arithmetic mean, and then multiply the arithmetic mean by the time interval. We got this formula.（我们在上一页中有以下公式。 d平方z除以dt等于v。我们是这样推导出这个公式的：从这个式子出发，最终得到这个公式。还记得上次我们是怎么做的吗？我们假设存在一个等于该值的速度，且为匀加速运动时，首先计算时间间隔内的平均速度——取初速度和末速度的算术平均值，再乘以时间间隔，就得到了这个公式。）

It's a correct argument. But in mathematics, that procedure becomes regularized by calculus. Namely, from this you can integrate. The integration gives you dz dt is equal to the integral d square z dt squared dt. And that is equal to the integral of v zero z minus minus gt dt. This is a linear expression.（这是一个正确的论点。但在数学中，这个过程通过微积分变得规范化。也就是说，由此你可以进行积分。积分得到dz dt等于d平方z dt平方dt的积分。这等于v零z减去负gt dt的积分。这是一个线性表达式。）

-------------
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}=(v_{z})_{0}-gt$$
积分：$$\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} = \int\frac{\mathrm{d}^2z}{\mathrm{d}t^2} \mathrm{d}t = \int(-g)\mathrm{d}t$$
$$z = \int \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}t=\int(\left(v_{z})_{0}-gt \right) \mathrm{d}t=(v_{z})_{0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+z_{0}$$

-----------------

And the linear expression, you can look up the formula and you get the result. This depends on a formula which is a tn dt is equal to a plus constant. This is in appendix E. What I'm telling you is the following.Starting from the velocity, which is linear in t, we argue that, starting from the d square z dt squared, which is a constant, z is equal to, I wrote this wrong, z is equal to the integral dz dt dt. So it's equal to this. This is the result. （线性表达式，你可以查阅公式并得到结果。这取决于一个公式，即tn dt等于a加上常数。这在附录E中。我要告诉你的是以下内容。从速度开始，它是t的线性函数，我们论证，从d平方z dt平方开始，它是一个常数，z等于，我写错了，z等于dz dt dt的积分。所以它等于这个。这就是结果。)

We argue that by saying that we took the average velocity, which is the arithmetic mean of the beginning velocity and the final velocity. But in calculus, it becomes a rule. It becomes you don't have to think. You use a formula like this. This formula is very important. And that formula you can find in appendix E in the book. So gradually, as time goes on, we are going to switch to using more calculus. I just talked about projectile motion. Do you have any questions? It's very simple. (我们认为，通过取平均速度（即初速度和末速度的算术平均值）可以解释这一点。但在微积分中，这变成了一条规则。你不需要思考，直接套用这样的公式即可。这个公式非常重要。你可以在本书的附录E中找到该公式。*随着时间的推移，我们将逐渐转向更多地使用微积分*。我刚才讲了抛体运动。你们有什么问题吗？这很简单。)

#### 例题

（这个示例对应的是教材 12th 示例问题 4.4.2）

OK. Now let's do a sample problem in the book. The sample problem says there is an airplane, which is flying at a height of 500 meters. It has a velocity, which is a uniform velocity, which is 55.0 meters per second. It releases a bomb. When the bomb is released, at the time that it's released, it goes with the airplane, so it has the same velocity at that time.(好的。现在我们来做一个书上的例题。例题说有一架飞机，飞行高度为500米。它以匀速运动，速度为每秒55.0米。当炸弹被释放时，在释放的那一刻，它会跟随飞机一起运动，因此此时炸弹具有与飞机相同的速度。)

But then it begins to fall. The vx of the bomb has the same initial value as the velocity of the plane. And from what we have learned, it will remain that. Therefore, the plane and the bomb, at each moment, would be on the same vertical line. In other words, at every moment, the pilot of the plane can see the bomb directly under him. So at the time that the bomb hits the ground, it's like this.(但随后它开始下落。炸弹的水平速度与飞机的初始速度相同。根据我们所学的知识，这一速度将保持不变。因此，飞机和炸弹在每一刻都处于同一条垂直线上。换句话说，飞行员随时都能看到炸弹正下方。所以当炸弹撞击地面时，情况是这样的。)

Suppose the time is t. So the motion of the projectile, of the bomb, this way, is the height of this is equal to one-half gt squared. Because it's just like a free fall. Therefore, since we know h, since we know g, so we get t. t is equal to 2h divided by g square root.(假设时间为t。那么炸弹或抛射体的运动轨迹是这样的，其高度等于二分之一乘以g乘以t的平方。因为这就像自由落体运动一样。因此，既然我们已知h和g，就可以求出t。t等于2h除以g的平方根。)

$$h=\frac{1}{2}gt^2, \quad t = \sqrt{ \frac{2h}{g} };\quad \text{这里的 h 是指下落的距离}$$

Suppose this distance, we now want to know what is the distance traveled by the plane at the time that the bomb hits the ground. So that's x. x, therefore, is equal to v0 times t. So it's equal to v0 times square root of 2h over g. It is equal to 55.0 meters times the square root of 2 times 500 meters divided by 9.78 meters per second squared. I now want to give you two rules.（假设这段距离，我们现在想知道炸弹落地时飞机飞行的距离。这就是x。因此，x等于v0乘以t。即等于v0乘以2h除以g的平方根。具体等于55.0米乘以2乘以500米除以9.78米每秒平方的平方根。现在我想给你两条规则。）

$$x=v_{0}t=v_{0}\sqrt{ \frac{2h}{g} }$$

First, do not substitute, do not use numbers until the end. This is the calculation just now. For example, when you get to this h part, you can figure it out. Because you already know this t. You know h, you know g, so you can figure it out. Many students have a tendency to figure it out. This is not good.(首先，不要替换，直到最后都不要使用数字。这是刚才的计算。例如，当你到达这个h部分时，你可以算出来。因为你已经知道这个t。你知道h，你知道g，所以你可以算出来。许多学生有算出来的倾向。这不好。)

Because if you calculate it in the middle, it's not necessary. You have to finish the last formula first. Then put the numbers in.Do not use numbers until the end. This is a trick. The second is check dimension. What is check dimension? Look at this. There is a meter here. The meter is eliminated.(因为如果你在中间计算，这是不必要的。你必须先完成最后的公式。然后再把数字代入。不要在一开始就用数字。这是一个技巧。第二点是检查量纲。什么是检查量纲？看这里。这里有一个米。这个米被消去了。)

The second squared is under the denominator. So when you get to the denominator, it becomes the second squared. The second squared is in the open square. I got this wrong. This is 55.0 meters per second. The second is eliminated with the second. The second is eliminated. So in the end, it's a meter. So it's right.(第二的平方在分母下面。所以当你到达分母时，它就变成了第二的平方。第二的平方在开平方里。我弄错了这个。这是55.0米每秒。第二与第二相消。第二被消去了。所以最后，它是一米。所以这是对的。)

If you get to this point, it's easy to check. If this check is wrong, your formula is a little wrong. If you use these two, it's easy to calculate. The result is 556 meters. Does everybody understand the two rules that I mentioned? Especially during examination, you are under pressure. Do not put in the numbers until the very end.(如果你进行到这一步，就很容易验证了。如果这个验证有误，那你的公式就有点问题。如果使用这两个方法，计算起来就很简单。结果是556米。大家都明白我刚才提到的两条规则吗？尤其是在考试的时候，你们会有压力。不到最后一刻，不要代入数字。)

If you put in numbers, you are likely to make mistakes. And then the mistakes with the compound itself, so that eventually you would have a paper which is very messy and wrong. Next, we'll talk about the circular motion, uniform circular motion.(如果你只输入数字，很容易出错。而这些错误又会与复合体本身产生连锁反应，最终导致整篇论文变得混乱不堪且错误百出。接下来，我们将讨论圆周运动——匀速圆周运动。)

It's on the west side of Erxiaomen. Then I finished elementary school there and went to Chongde Middle School. It's in the city. Now it's Rongxiang Hutong 21st Middle School. I studied there for four years. I finished my first year of high school.(它在二校门的西侧。然后我在那里完成了小学学业，去了崇德中学。这所学校在城里。现在它是荣巷胡同第21中学。我在那里学习了四年。我完成了高中的第一年。)

Then the anti-Japanese war began. From my second year of high school, I went to two schools. First in Hefei, then in Kunming. So I didn't study physics in high school. I studied a little bit of physics in junior high school, but I didn't study uniform circular motion. I didn't study physics in high school for two years, between 1936 and 1938.(随后抗日战争爆发。从高二开始，我辗转了两所学校，先是在合肥，后来到了昆明。因此高中阶段我并未学习物理课程。初中时虽接触过一点物理知识，但并未涉及匀速圆周运动的内容。1936至1938年间，整整两年我的高中物理学习是完全中断的。)

Then in the summer of 1938, I finished my second year of high school. The Ministry of Education suddenly said that there were too many middle school students, so they didn't want to study uniform circular motion. So they decided to take the college entrance exam.(1938年夏天，我高中二年级刚结束。教育部突然宣布中学生人数过多，不再要求学习匀速圆周运动，于是决定直接参加高考。)

So I decided to take the college entrance exam. To take the college entrance exam, you have to take the entrance exam. In the entrance exam, there is always physics. So I had to study physics by myself. So I studied physics for a month. I found a textbook for this month. I don't remember what book it was. I studied for a month. Then I took the exam.(于是我决定参加高考。要参加高考，就必须先通过入学考试。而入学考试中总有物理这一科。所以我不得不自学物理。就这样，我自学了一个月的物理。这期间我找了本教材来看，具体是哪本书已经记不清了。苦读一个月后，我终于参加了考试。)

This month had a decisive impact on my life. Why? Why? Because when I took the exam, I was supposed to study chemistry. In that month, I found that physics was very interesting. So I decided to study physics. So as soon as I entered college, I immediately switched from chemistry to physics. Why do I think physics is interesting? I still remember very clearly which concept made me change to physics.(这个月对我的生活产生了决定性的影响。为什么？为什么？因为当我参加考试时，我本该学习化学。在那个月里，我发现物理非常有趣。所以我决定学习物理。因此，我一进入大学，就立即从化学转到了物理。为什么我认为物理有趣？我仍然非常清楚地记得是哪个概念让我转到了物理。)

It was the uniform circular motion. Because I used to have an intuition. I think you all have an intuition. Intuition. When it comes to uniform motion, the most important thing is the tangent vector. I think every child has this intuition. But the book told me that the acceleration is not in that direction. It's perpendicular to it. So the acceleration is a tangent.(这是匀速圆周运动。因为我曾经有一种直觉。我想你们都有这种直觉。直觉。说到匀速运动，最重要的是切向量。我认为每个孩子都有这种直觉。但书上告诉我加速度不在那个方向上。它垂直于它。所以加速度是一个切线。)

Its velocity is like this. Its acceleration is like this. I found this very strange at first. But when I understood it, I realized that if you are sitting in a car, and the car is turning, the pressure you are under is perpendicular. So the theory of physics actually matches your experience. I thought this was very interesting, so I changed to physics.(它的速度是这样的。它的加速度是这样的。起初我觉得这非常奇怪。但当我理解后，我意识到如果你坐在一辆车里，而车正在转弯，你所承受的压力是垂直的。所以物理理论实际上与你的经验相符。我觉得这非常有趣，所以我转学了物理。)

After thinking about this, I came to a conclusion. This conclusion is very important for you to learn anything, especially physics. A person has all kinds of intuitions at any time. Of course, you have an intuition since you were a child. You have an intuition for survival. Even a dog knows that the shortest distance is the straight line. This is its intuition. So we have some intuitions. If you want to survive, you must have an intuition.(经过一番思考，我得出了一个结论。这个结论对于学习任何东西都非常重要，尤其是物理学。一个人在任何时候都有各种各样的直觉。当然，你从小就有直觉。你有生存的直觉。就连狗也知道最短的距离是直线。这是它的直觉。所以我们有一些直觉。如果你想生存，就必须有直觉。)

When you learn something, sometimes the result is different from your intuition. As I said, I realized that acceleration is not in the direction of speed, but in the direction of perpendicularity. When I first saw this, I thought it was different from my intuition. In this case, it is the most important thing to learn. You have to think about it clearly. You can't give up.(学习新知识时，结果有时会与直觉相悖。正如我所说，我意识到加速度并非沿着速度方向，而是垂直于速度方向。初次接触这个概念时，我觉得它与我的直觉认知完全不同。这种情况下，正是最需要深入学习的关键所在。你必须彻底想明白，绝不能轻言放弃。)

If you think about it clearly, you will change your intuition. In the future, you will have a more correct intuition. In other words, you have to change your intuition at any time. The increased intuition is very important. Many of the research I have done in my life are about symmetry. Symmetry is a very complicated concept.(如果你仔细思考，就会改变你的直觉。未来，你会拥有更准确的直觉。换句话说，你必须随时调整你的直觉。提升后的直觉非常重要。我一生中做的许多研究都是关于对称性的。对称性是一个非常复杂的概念。)

You have a mathematical formula. This is not enough. You have to turn that mathematical formula into your intuition. The first time I learned about this was when I went to the United States to study at Chicago University. Taylor and I later became very famous because he was called the father of the hydrogen bomb. Because he invented a trick in the American hydrogen bomb.(你有一个数学公式。这还不够。你必须将这个数学公式转化为你的直觉。我第一次了解到这一点是在我去美国芝加哥大学学习的时候。泰勒和我后来变得非常有名，因为他被称为氢弹之父。因为他在美国氢弹中发明了一个技巧。)

When I talked to him, I found out that he was very good at the principle of symmetry. But he didn't know what it was. Gradually, I learned that his principle of symmetry was in his intuition. But his intuition had not yet turned it into a formula. This gave me a deep impression. In other words, when it comes to studying complex physics, there are specific things and intuition.(当我与他交谈时，发现他非常擅长对称性原理。但他并不知道那是什么。渐渐地，我了解到他的对称性原理存在于他的直觉中。但他的直觉尚未将其转化为公式。这给我留下了深刻的印象。换句话说，在研究复杂物理学时，既需要具体的事物，也需要直觉。)

These two things need to complement each other. If these two things are not right, you have to sit down and think carefully. Why is your original intuition wrong? When you have thought this through, you will turn what you have inferred into your new intuition.(这两件事需要相辅相成。如果这两件事出了问题，你就得坐下来仔细思考：为什么你最初的直觉是错误的？当你把这个问题想明白后，就会把推断出的结论转化为新的直觉。)

This is a very important way of learning. If you can't figure it out, you can't just let it go. Because you won't be able to go back to the same situation. The uniform circular motion is actually very simple. Why? Because the magnitude of this acceleration... We need to prove this. Let me write down the formula first.(这是一种非常重要的学习方法。如果你弄不明白，就不能轻易放过。因为你无法再回到同样的情境。匀速圆周运动其实很简单。为什么呢？因为这个加速度的大小...我们需要证明这一点。让我先把公式写下来。)

$$a=\frac{v^2}{R}$$

Magnitude is V square over R. R is its radius. V is its velocity. Direction towards center. This is called centripetal. Centripetal acceleration. Centripetal is the direction. Centrifugal is the direction. There is a term called centrifugal force. This centrifugal force... You'd better forget this term. Its acceleration is the direction. This is centripetal. This is centripetal.(大小等于V的平方除以R。R是半径。V是速度。方向指向中心。这被称为向心。向心加速度。向心是方向。离心是方向。有个术语叫离心力。这个离心力……你最好忘掉这个术语。它的加速度方向是这样的。这是向心。这是向心。)

Centripetal acceleration. We need to prove this formula. At this point, there is a velocity like this. It's its tangent. At this point, it's still the same. The length of the velocity vector is the same. But it has changed direction. For example, this is called V prime. V prime is the later V. What is acceleration? It's delta V. We need to calculate the acceleration.(向心加速度。我们需要证明这个公式。此时，有一个这样的速度。它是它的切线。此时，它仍然是相同的。速度矢量的长度相同。但它改变了方向。例如，这个称为V撇。V撇是后来的V。加速度是什么？它是ΔV。我们需要计算加速度。)

--------------------

a想象有一个等腰三角形，一个腰为 $\vec{v}$，另一个腰为 $\vec{v'}$，$\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{v'}-\vec{v}$，方向由 $\vec{v'}$ 指向 $\vec{v}$，则平均加速度 $$a_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\vec{v'}-\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$$
由于这两个速度都与对应的半径垂直，两个半径之间的旋转角为 $\theta$，那么两个腰之间的夹角也是 $\theta$, 或者称为 $\Delta \theta$，等于角速度x时间：
$$\Delta \theta=\left|\frac{v}{r}\right| \Delta t$$

所以：$$a_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\vec{v'}-\vec{v}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\vec{v'}-\vec{v}}{r\Delta \theta }v$$
分子，即 $\Delta \vec{v}$ 当取极限时，方向是垂直于 $v$。

-------------------

It's delta V over delta t. It's the average acceleration. You draw a line here. This is V. This is V prime. This is delta V. So, the average acceleration is V prime minus V divided by delta t. V prime minus V is a small... Let me draw it bigger. This is V. This is V prime. This is delta V. This angle is called theta.(这是ΔV除以Δt，也就是平均加速度。你在这里画一条线。这是V，这是V'。这是ΔV。所以，平均加速度等于V'减去V再除以Δt。V'减去V是一个很小的...让我画大一点。这是V，这是V'。这是ΔV。这个角度叫做θ。)

Or it's called delta theta. These two are perpendicular to each other. So, this angle is also called delta theta. What is delta theta? Its velocity is V. Its tangent is R. So, V over R is the angular velocity. Angular velocity. Of course, we use radians for angular velocity.（或者称之为δθ。这两者是相互垂直的。因此，这个角度也被称为δθ。δθ是什么？它的速度是V。它的切线是R。所以，V除以R就是角速度。角速度。当然，我们用弧度来表示角速度。   ）

We don't need to use radians for the correct calculation. This is the angular velocity multiplied by time. This is of course delta theta. So, our average velocity, our average acceleration is V prime minus V divided by delta theta multiplied by R. V prime minus V is a vector. The angle of this vector is a triangle. When this triangle collapses into a line, in which direction is delta V? Of course, it's perpendicular to V. So, the first statement is as delta T goes to zero, the triangle, this triangle, collapses.(我们不需要使用弧度来进行正确计算。这是角速度乘以时间。这当然是Δθ。因此，我们的平均加速度等于V'减去V再除以Δθ乘以R。V'减V是一个矢量。这个矢量的夹角构成一个三角形。当这个三角形坍缩成一条线时，ΔV的方向指向哪里？当然是垂直于V的方向。所以第一个结论是：当ΔT趋近于零时，这个三角形就会坍缩。)

The direction of delta V has a direction has a direction perpendicular to V. I believe centripetal. This is the first part about its direction. The second part is about its size. What is the size? What is V prime minus V? What is the magnitude? What is the length of delta V? Of course, you draw a line here. This is an equilateral triangle. So, it's half of two times.（ΔV的方向垂直于V。我相信这是向心力。这是关于其方向的第一部分。第二部分是关于它的大小。大小是多少？V'减去V是多少？它的模是多少？ΔV的长度是多少？当然，你在这里画一条线。这是一个等边三角形。所以，它是两倍的一半。）

What is half? It's V times sine of delta theta over two. Do you agree or disagree? These are two equilateral triangles. Each equilateral triangle has this length. So, V times sine of this angle. So, I put it here. So, it's average velocity.（什么是半？就是V乘以sin(Δθ/2)。你同意还是不同意？这是两个等边三角形。每个等边三角形都有这个长度。所以，V乘以这个角度的sin值。所以，我把它放在这里。所以，这是平均速度。）

---------------

在等腰三角形过顶点画垂线，则 $\Delta v$ 被分为两半，$\Delta \theta$ 也被分为两半，则 $\frac{1}{2} \Delta v=v \sin\left( \frac{\Delta \theta}{2} \right)$ 

$$a_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\vec{v'}-\vec{v}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\vec{v'}-\vec{v}}{r\Delta \theta }v=\frac{2\times v \sin\left( \frac{\Delta \theta}{2} \right) \times v}{r \Delta \theta}$$

当 $x \to 0$ 时，$\sin x = x$，所以当 $\Delta t \to 0$，有 $\Delta \theta \to 0$，则 $a=\frac{v^2}{r}$


----------------

Its magnitude is equal to V over R delta theta times this magnitude times two V sine delta theta over two. It's equal to V squared over R times two sine delta theta over two divided by delta theta. What is delta theta over two?(其大小等于V除以R乘以Δθ，再乘以这个大小乘以2V乘以sin(Δθ/2)。它等于V的平方除以R乘以2sin(Δθ/2)再除以Δθ。Δθ/2是什么？)

----- 30 分钟分割线（休息时间）-----------

This quantity, sine of delta theta over 2, divided by delta theta over 2. When delta theta becomes 0, it becomes 1. So this is how we approach V-square over r. Here we use a formula. The formula is sine of an angle phi, divided by phi over 2, approaches 0, approaches 1. We use this formula. If I don't let phi be very small, there is a more accurate formula.（这个量，即sin(Δθ/2)除以Δθ/2，当Δθ趋近于0时，其值趋近于1。这就是我们如何得到 V²/r 的过程。这里我们使用了一个公式：sin(φ)/φ，当φ趋近于0时，其值趋近于1。我们运用了这个公式。如果我不让φ非常小，还有一个更精确的公式。）

Who knows this formula? Who knows what sine of phi is? Raise your hand if you know. What is it? Phi minus phi cubed, divided by 3 factorial, plus phi 5 times, divided by 5 factorial. It is also in the appendix.（谁知道这个公式？谁知道正弦函数φ的值是多少？知道的请举手。它是什么？φ减去φ的立方，除以3的阶乘，再加上φ的五次方，除以5的阶乘。这在附录中也有。）

$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\cdots $$

If you accept this formula, Newton would know. In fact, Newton knew it before. China has never developed a formula like this. It has a close relationship with modern science that China has never developed. But if you accept this formula, when you divide this by phi, both sides are divided by phi, so the first side is 1. The rest is at least phi squared. So when phi is very small, it is not there.(如果你接受这个公式，牛顿会知道。事实上，牛顿早就知道了。中国从未发展出这样的公式。它与现代科学有着密切的关系，而中国从未发展出这样的科学。但如果你接受这个公式，当你用phi除两边时，两边都除以phi，所以第一边是1。剩下的至少是phi的平方。因此，当phi非常小时，它就不存在了。)

So it becomes 1. These two are very important formulas. Okay, do we have a proof now? Let's think about what's going on. When something is doing a circle, when it is doing a circle, acceleration means how does the velocity change.(所以这就变成了1。这两个是非常重要的公式。好了，我们现在有证明了吗？让我们想想发生了什么。当某物在做圆周运动时，当它在做圆周运动时，加速度意味着速度如何变化。)

The velocity is in the tangent direction, and the tangent direction is a little bit inside. So there is a change in the middle. The direction of that change is positive in the end.And its magnitude needs to go through this calculation. This calculation is very simple. This formula is very important.(速度方向沿着切线方向，而切线方向稍微向内。因此中间会有变化。最终这个变化的方向是正向的。其大小需要通过这个计算得出。这个计算非常简单。这个公式非常重要。)

As I said, is there any problem with the circular motion? What happens if it is an uniform motion? If it moves faster and faster, then you can imagine that in addition to an acceleration in the positive direction, there is also an acceleration in the tangent direction. The reason why there is no acceleration in the tangent direction is because its length is not increasing. Let's change that a little bit.(如我所说，圆周运动有什么问题吗？如果是匀速运动会发生什么？如果运动越来越快，那么你可以想象除了正向加速度外，还有一个切线方向的加速度。之所以切线方向没有加速度，是因为它的长度没有增加。让我们稍微改变一下这一点。)

Which is parallel to v, and not perpendicular to v. And in fact, that was also a thing which Newton realized. So Newton studied how Earth goes around the Sun. Acceleration is not uniform circular motion.(它平行于v，而不垂直于v。事实上，这也是牛顿意识到的一点。因此，牛顿研究了地球如何绕太阳运行。加速度不是匀速圆周运动。)

So therefore, when you talk about that, you need acceleration, which both has a tangential component and a component perpendicular to the tangent. What we have done is a geometrical proof. Now I want to do the same thing, but an algebraic proof of the same.(因此，当你讨论这个问题时，需要引入加速度的概念，它既包含切向分量，也包含垂直于切线的分量。我们刚才所做的是一个几何证明。现在我想做同样的事情，但采用代数方法来证明同一个问题。)

Let's first write the coordinates. Let's assume that it's going through a motion like this. Let us define omega.  Omega is equal to angular velocity. So it's equal to v over r. Normally in physics, angular velocity is written as omega. So this is x, and this is y. So what is x equal to? x is equal to r cosine omega t. y is equal to r sine omega t. Now let's calculate velocity.(首先写下坐标。假设物体做这样的运动。我们来定义ω（omega）。ω等于角速度，即v除以r。在物理学中，角速度通常用ω表示。这是x轴，这是y轴。那么x等于什么？x等于r乘以cos(ωt)。y等于r乘以sin(ωt)。现在来计算速度。)

$$\text{角速度 } \omega = \frac{v}{r}; \quad x = r \cos \omega t;\quad y=r\sin \omega t$$

It's dx dt. Who can differentiate cosine omega t? What's the derivative of cosine x? It's minus sine x. It's not cosine x, it's cosine omega t. So we have to use a chain rule. If you haven't learned it, you will learn it in a few days.(这是dx/dt。谁能对cos(ωt)求导？cos(x)的导数是什么？是-sin(x)。但这里不是cos(x)，而是cos(ωt)。所以我们必须使用链式法则。如果你还没学过这个法则，过几天你就会学到了。)

You have to make it intuitive. You don't have to think about it. So it's equal to minus omega sine omega t. dy dt is equal to r cosine omega t. Because the derivative of sine is equal to plus cosine.(你必须让它变得直观。你不需要去思考它。所以它等于负ω乘以sin(ωt)。dy/dt等于r乘以cos(ωt)。因为sin的导数等于正cos。)

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\omega r \sin \omega t; \quad \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = \omega r \cos \omega t$$

The derivative of cosine is equal to minus sine. Let me differentiate it again. dx dt is equal to minus r cosine omega t. dy dt is equal to minus r sine omega t. But what is this equal to? This is equal to... So dx dt is equal to minus omega squared x. d squared y dt squared is equal to minus omega squared y. In other words, d squared r dt squared is equal to minus omega squared r. So this is equal to... Omega squared is v squared over r squared times r. (余弦的导数等于负的正弦。让我再微分一次。dx dt 等于负r余弦ωt。dy dt 等于负r正弦ωt。但这等于什么？这等于...所以dx dt 等于负ω平方x。d平方y dt平方等于负ω平方y。换句话说，d平方r dt平方等于负ω平方r。所以这等于...ω平方等于v平方除以r平方乘以r。)

$$a_{x}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\omega^2 r \cos \omega t; \quad a_{y}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\omega^2 r \sin \omega t$$

由于 $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$ 所以，$\omega^2r=\frac{v^2}{r}$，所以 $a=\sqrt{ a^2_{x} + a^2_{y} }=\frac{v^2}{r}$


Then you can write it as minus v squared over r times r over r. What is r over r? It's the unit vector in the direction of r. What is negative r over r? It's the unit vector in the direction of r. So this means that the acceleration is in the direction of r. The direction is in the direction of r. Its magnitude is v squared over r. This is what we just proved with geometric.(那么你可以把它写成负v平方除以r乘以r除以r。r除以r是什么？它是r方向的单位向量。负r除以r是什么？它是r方向的单位向量。所以这意味着加速度的方向是r的方向。方向是r的方向。它的大小是v平方除以r。这就是我们刚才用几何方法证明的。)

Do you like geometric or algebra? The answer is that you both like it. These two things are one thing. But as we said last time, each has its own advantages. In fact, when it comes to very complicated things, both are fine. But usually, geometric is more intuitive. And everyone who studies physics, theory of physics, or mathematics has a preference.(你喜欢几何还是代数？答案是两者都喜欢。这两者其实是一回事。但正如我们上次所说，它们各有优势。实际上，在处理非常复杂的问题时，两者都适用。但通常来说，几何更直观一些。每个研究物理、物理理论或数学的人都有自己的偏好。)

Some people prefer geometric. Some people prefer algebra. This can't be forced. But people who like geometric should know what algebra is and vice versa. I've been talking for a long time. Actually, I think we've been talking for two and a half lessons. (有人喜欢几何，有人喜欢代数，这强求不得。但喜欢几何的人应该了解代数是什么，反之亦然。我已经说了很久。其实，我觉得我们已经讲了两节半课了。)

There's nothing complicated. But the uniform circular motion is a little bit complicated. It's all very simple. What I'm going to talk about is not in the lesson. Because I mentioned it last time. I think maybe some people who are interested in this don't quite understand what I'm talking about.(这并不复杂。但匀速圆周运动有点复杂。其实都很简单。底下我要讲的内容不在课程里。因为我上次已经提到过。我想可能有些对此感兴趣的人不太明白我在说什么。)

I'll talk about it in detail. I'll introduce a concept called transfinite numbers. It's infinite. Usually two things are the same. For example, three biscuits are the same as three pens. What does that mean? If you analyze it carefully, it can become one-to-one correspondence.(我来详细讲一下。我要介绍一个叫做超限数的概念。它是无限的。通常两样东西是一样的。比如说，三块饼干和三支笔是一样的。这是什么意思呢？如果你仔细分析，它可以变成一一对应。)

It can be one-to-one. You can put three biscuits in a row. Three pens in a row correspond to each other. What's the advantage? Three biscuits can't correspond to four pens. Four pens are more than three biscuits. So we have an intuition.（可以是一对一的。你可以把三块饼干排成一排。三支笔排成一排相互对应。有什么好处呢？三块饼干不能对应四支笔。四支笔比三块饼干多。所以我们有一种直觉。）

What is the same number? Which pen is bigger than the other? That's what people used to say. But in the 19th century, people started to discuss what transfinite numbers were. When you think about it, there are a lot of things you didn't think about before.（哪个数字是相同的？哪支笔比另一支大？人们过去常这么说。但在 19 世纪，人们开始讨论什么是超限数。当你仔细思考时，会发现有很多以前从未想过的事情。）

For example, can all the odd numbers correspond to all the even numbers? Of course. Of course they can. Let's say n corresponds to 2n.（例如，所有的偶数与所有的正整数都一一对应吗？当然可以。比如说，n 对应 2n。）

On the other side, I put n, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. On the other side, I put 2n, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Of course they can correspond to each other. Doesn't that mean all the even numbers are as many as all the even integers? So when you use the concept of one-to-one correspondence to infinite numbers, a phenomenon occurs.（在另一边，我放上n、1、2、3、4、5、6、7、8。另一边则放上2n、2、4、6、8等等。它们当然可以一一对应。这不就意味着所有偶数和所有整数一样多吗？所以当你用一一对应的概念处理无限数时，就会出现这种现象。）

Because the even numbers are only half of all the integers. But they can correspond to each other. In other words, when you have infinite numbers, some of them can correspond to the original numbers.（因为偶数只是所有整数的一半。但它们可以一一对应。换句话说，当你有无限的数字时，其中一部分数字可以与原始数字一一对应。）

So you can say they are the same number. This is a big difference It was only in the 19th century that mathematicians started to think about this problem. The problem just now is not detailed enough.（所以你可以说它们是一样多的数字。这是一个很大的区别。直到 19 世纪，数学家才开始思考这个问题。刚才的问题描述得不够详细。）

In other words, all the even numbers correspond to all the integers. This is not detailed enough. In fact, all the even numbers all positive In fact, positive can also be simplified.（换句话说，所有的偶数都对应着所有的整数。这还不够详细。实际上，所有的正分数，事实上，"正"也可以简化掉）

All positive fractions can be made into one-to-one correspondence with all integers, all positive integers. All positive fractions that is A over B A and B are all positive integers. All positive fractions can be made into one-to-one correspondence with all positive integers.（所有正分数可以与所有整数、所有正整数建立一一对应关系。所有正分数即A除以B，其中A和B均为正整数。所有正分数都能与所有正整数形成一一对应关系。）

Why can I say this? It's very simple. I write all the positive fractions. This is 1 over 1 1 over 2 1 over 3 1 over 4 2 over 1 2 over 2 2 over 3 2 over 4 3 over 1 3 over 2 3 over 3 3 over 4 This is a big formula.（为什么我能这么说？这很简单。我写下了所有的正分数。这是1/1、1/2、1/3、1/4、2/1、2/2、2/3、2/4、3/1、3/2、3/3、3/4。这是一个庞大的公式。）

Does it include all the positive integers? Does it include all the positive fractions? In fact, it may include more than one. How can I correspond all the positive integers? It's very simple. I start from here.（它是否包括所有正整数？是否包括所有正分数？实际上，它可能包括不止一个。我该如何对应所有正整数？这很简单。我从这里开始。）

1 This is 2. 1, 2, 3, 4 There are many ways. If you keep going like this, you will go through the whole infinite formula. Then there will be one-to-one correspondence. In fact, you correspond all the positive integers with all the fractions. Some correspond more than once. In other words, all the integers are more than all the fractions.（这是2。1，2，3，4 有很多方法。如果你继续这样下去，你会遍历整个无限公式。然后就会有一一对应。事实上，你将所有正整数与所有分数对应起来。有些对应不止一次。换句话说，所有整数比所有分数多。（应该是分数比整数多））

So we can say all positive integers is equal to all positive fractions. This is very interesting. Why? If you take the numbers between 0 and 1, there are so many fractions between 0 and 1. 1 over 2, 1 over 4 1 over 2 1 over 2 is very close to 1 over 2. You can be very, very close to 1 over 2. There are countless fractions.（所以我们可以说所有正整数等于所有正分数。这非常有趣。为什么呢？如果你取0到1之间的数字，0到1之间有无数分数。1/2、1/4、1/2，1/2非常接近1/2。你可以无限接近1/2。分数是数不清的。）

So it's dense. If you draw 0 and 1 here, you put all the fractions in it. The fractions are everywhere dense. No matter how many intervals you take, there are countless fractions. How can they correspond to integers? In other words, when it comes to the infinite formula, the number, the number of concepts is completely different from ordinary intuition. This is what we need to study.（所以它很密集。如果你在这里画0和1，把所有的分数都放进去。分数无处不在，非常密集。无论你取多少区间，都有无数的分数。它们怎么能与整数对应呢？换句话说，当涉及到无限公式时，数字、概念的数量与普通直觉完全不同。这正是我们需要研究的。）

All right. We need to prove a very simple thing. All real numbers are greater than... I add one more point. Because the definition of greater than is different from ordinary definition. It is greater than the one-to-one correspondence. It is greater than all positive integers.（好的。我们需要证明一个非常简单的事情。所有实数都大于……我再补充一点。因为“大于”的定义与普通定义不同。它大于一一对应关系。它大于所有正整数。）

In particular, you don't need real numbers. All irrational numbers are all real numbers. This proof is very simple and very famous. I don't need to prove all real numbers. I just need to prove all real numbers between 0 and 1. The real number between 0 and 1 is of course less than all real numbers. But that is already greater than all positive integers.（特别是，你并不需要所有的实数。所有的无理数都是实数。这个证明非常简单且非常著名。我不需要证明所有的实数，只需要证明0到1之间的所有实数。0到1之间的实数当然比所有实数要少，但这已经比所有正整数还要多了。）

This proof is very simple. If it is not true, otherwise... Otherwise, it means that all real numbers between 0 and 1 can correspond to all positive integers. Then I will write it down. Otherwise, I can... I will write down the theorem of 0 and 1. The theorem of 0 and 1... First, I will write down the one-to-one correspondence. I will write down the one-to-two correspondence. I will write down the one-to-three correspondence.（这个证明非常简单。如果它不成立，否则……否则就意味着0到1之间的所有实数都能与所有正整数一一对应。那么我会把它写下来。否则，我可以……我会写下0和1的定理。0和1的定理……首先，我会写下一一对应。我会写下一对二的对应。我会写下一对三的对应。）

Then I can have the following correspondence. This is 1, this is 2, this is 3. This side is integer, and this side is the real number between 0 and 1. Now I will prove that the list on the right is incomplete. Why is it incomplete? I will take the first number.（那么我就可以建立如下对应关系。这是1，这是2，这是3。这边是整数，而这边是0到1之间的实数。现在我要证明右边的列表是不完整的。为什么不完整呢？我将选取第一个数字。）

I will take the first one, the second one, the third one, the fourth one, and change it. I will take the first one and add 1 to it. For example, I will take the second one and add 1 to it. Now I know that the real number below is the real number. The first one is different from this one. The second one is different from this one.（我要拿第一个、第二个、第三个、第四个，然后改变它们。我会拿第一个并给它加1。比如说，我会拿第二个并给它加1。现在我知道下面的数字才是真实的数字。第一个和这个不同。第二个和这个不同。）

The third one is different from this one. So I get a new number. This number is different from any number in this list. It is different from the third one because the third one is different. It is different from the fifth one because the fifth one is different. So this number is not in this list.（第三个与此不同。因此我得到了一个新数字。这个数字与列表中的任何数字都不同。它与第三个不同，因为第三个是不同的。它与第五个不同，因为第五个是不同的。所以这个数字不在列表中。）

This is a contradiction. This is called a proof. A proof like this is often seen here. So what impression do you get? All the real numbers are infinite. But this infinite number is less than all the real numbers. All the real numbers... This is a very complicated concept.（这是一个矛盾。这被称为证明。像这样的证明在这里经常见到。那么，你得到了什么印象？所有的实数都是无限的。但这个无限数却小于所有的实数。所有的实数……这是一个非常复杂的概念。）

It is not a simple concept. As I said just now, all the fractions between 0 and 1 are everywhere dense. All the fractions between 0 and 1 are everywhere dense. But even though it is infinite, and if you think too much, it is not too much. It is just as much as all the fractions. But if you add up all the fractions it becomes all the real numbers.（这并不是一个简单的概念。正如我刚才所说，0到1之间的所有分数无处不在且密集分布。0到1之间的所有分数无处不在且密集分布。但即便它是无限的，如果你思考得太多，其实也不算太多。它就和所有分数一样多。但如果你把所有分数加起来，它就变成了所有的实数。）

Then it is different from the original. So there is a problem. The problem is that between the real number and the positive integer, is there a middle one? Less than the real number. What is less than the real number? It cannot correspond to the real number but can correspond to a part of the real number. But it is less than all the integers. Is there such a middle one? This is a very famous problem called Continuum Hypothesis.（那么这与原来的不同。所以这里有一个问题。问题是，在实数和正整数之间，是否存在一个中间的数？比实数小。比实数小的是什么？它不能对应实数，但可以对应实数的一部分。但它比所有整数都小。是否存在这样的中间数？这是一个非常著名的问题，叫做连续统假设。）

Continuum Hypothesis can assume that there is an infinite number between all the integers and all the real numbers. I remember when I was studying in the Soviet Union, I heard about this. It was just a coincidence.（连续统假设可以认为在所有整数和所有实数之间存在无限多个数。我记得在西南联大时听说过这个，纯属偶然。）

So I thought about it. But I couldn't figure it out. Now that I think about it, only an expert can figure it out. This problem was solved by a mathematician called Paul Cohen in the 1960s. He proved that you can assume that there is such an infinite number. There is such an infinite number between these two integers.（于是我想了想。但我搞不明白。现在想来，只有专家才能弄懂这个问题。这个问题在20世纪60年代由一位名叫保罗·科恩的数学家解决了。他证明了可以假设存在这样一个无限数。在这两个整数之间存在这样一个无限数。）

This logical system can continue to develop without any internal contradictions. But you can also assume that there is no such thing. In other words, Continuum Hypothesis is something that cannot be decided.（这个逻辑系统可以不断发展而不产生任何内部矛盾。但你也可以假设不存在这样的东西。换句话说，连续统假设是一个无法被决定的问题。）

It is something that cannot be decided in the current mathematical logical system. It cannot be decided whether there is such a thing or not. Whether there is such a thing or not, each of them can produce different mathematical conclusions.（在当前数学逻辑体系中无法确定这一点。无法判定是否存在这样的事物。无论存在与否，每一种情况都可能得出不同的数学结论。）

Of course, I don't understand how he proved it. I don't think ordinary mathematicians understand it either. But only experts can understand it. This kind of research is close to mathematical logic. I can say that this kind of research is far away from the Chinese tradition. This tradition is like the Germans who like to go in this direction.（当然，我不明白他是如何证明的。我想普通数学家也不明白。但只有专家才能理解。这类研究接近于数理逻辑。可以说，这类研究与中国传统相去甚远。这种传统就像德国人喜欢走这个方向一样。）

This is the way of thinking of a nation and it has something to do with what kind of questions they like to ask. In this regard, at least I think this is of course controversial. But I think the traditional Chinese culture does not pay much attention to this kind of thinking.（这是一个民族的思维方式，与他们喜欢提出什么样的问题有关。至少在我看来，这一点当然是有争议的。但我认为中国传统文化并不太重视这种思维方式。）

So in the last few minutes, I told you about a shallow trans-finite number development. In this direction, it is closely related to the development of computers. We are very happy to invite Professor Yao Qi Zhi because his research is closely related to this.（所以在过去的几分钟里，我向大家介绍了一个浅显的超限数发展。在这个方向上，它与计算机的发展密切相关。我们非常高兴邀请到姚期智教授，因为他的研究与此紧密相关。）

The basic theory of software is closely related to mathematical logic. I also discussed division algebra. I think my discussion last time was too simple. You probably didn't even understand the definition. So I think I have to... Let me see which page it is now. I said last time that there are three types of division algebra.（软件的基本理论与数理逻辑密切相关。我还讨论了可除代数。我觉得上次的讨论过于简单了。你可能连定义都没听懂。所以我觉得必须......让我看看现在翻到哪一页了。我上次说过可除代数共有三种类型。）

Real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions. I have to make it clearer this time. I think the simplest way is to talk about complex numbers first. What are complex numbers? They are a plus bi.（实数、复数、四元数。这次我必须讲得更清楚些。我认为最简单的方式是先谈谈复数。复数是什么？它们是a加bi。）

----- 30 分钟分割线（休息时间）-----------


We can add, we can subtract, we can multiply, we can divide, provided the denominator is not zero. This is called a division algebra. Real numbers themselves are also a division algebra. So what does it mean to generalize it? It means general division algebra. What is a general division algebra? It's the number inside it. It's the number inside it.（我们可以相加，可以相减，可以相乘，可以相除，只要分母不为零。这被称为可除代数。实数本身也是一个可除代数。那么推广它意味着什么？意味着广义的可除代数。什么是广义的可除代数？就是它里面的数。就是它里面的数。）

It's a little bit like just now. It's A plus B1 plus B2 plus ... plus Bn. It's not just one i. It has a lot of things like i. It's called xi1, xi2, xin. So here A, B, and I are real numbers. These xi's are different things. These things need a multiplication rule.（这有点像刚才的情况。它是A加B1加B2加……加Bn。不只是一个i，而是有很多类似i的东西，叫做xi1、xi2、xin。所以这里的A、B和I都是实数。这些xi是不同的东西。这些东西需要一个乘法规则。）

$$\alpha = a+b_{1}\xi_{1}+b_{2}\xi_{2}+\cdots b_{n}\xi_{n}$$
这里的 $a,b$ 都是实数，$\xi_{i}\xi_{j}$ 是这个系统中的一个 $\alpha$ 数字，这意味着

$$\xi_{i}\xi_{j}=a_{ij}+b_{1ij}\xi_{1}+b_{2ij}\xi_{2}+\cdots$$

So xi i, xi j is an alpha, a number in the system. That means it can be written as sum A plus ij. What are i and j? It's B1ij, xi1, plus B2ij, xi2, plus ... This is a multiplication table. This is called a multiplication table. Every xi times a xi, including i equals j, which is xi squared, needs a multiplication table. This is defined algebra.(所以xi i，xi j是系统中的一个alpha值，一个数字。这意味着它可以表示为sum A加上ij。i和j是什么？它是B1ij，xi1，加上B2ij，xi2，再加上... 这是一个乘法表。这被称为乘法表。每一个xi乘以一个xi，包括i等于j的情况，也就是xi的平方，都需要一个乘法表。这是代数定义的。)

What kind of conditions can we call this algebra? It has to meet some conditions. For example, it has to meet associative law. What is associative law? Alpha times beta times gamma equals alpha times beta times gamma. It has to meet distributive law. What is distributive law? Alpha times beta times gamma equals alpha times beta times alpha times gamma. But it may not meet commutative law.(我们称这种代数需要满足什么条件呢？它必须满足某些条件。例如，它必须满足结合律。什么是结合律？α乘以β乘以γ等于α乘以β乘以γ。它还必须满足分配律。什么是分配律？α乘以β加γ等于α乘以β加α乘以γ。但它可能不满足交换律。)

结合律：$(\alpha \beta) \gamma = \alpha(\beta \gamma)$；     分配率：$\alpha(\beta+\gamma)=\alpha \beta+\alpha \gamma$    交换律：$\alpha \beta =\beta \alpha$ （不一定成立）

Commutative law is alpha times beta times beta times alpha. This may not be right. Then it can have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has to meet this kind of algebra. This kind of algebraic system is called division algebra. Fundamental theorem says that this multiplication table meets all these conditions.(交换律就是阿尔法乘以贝塔等于贝塔乘以阿尔法。这可能不太对。然后它可以有加法、减法、乘法和除法。它必须满足这种代数。这种代数系统被称为可除代数。基本定理说这个乘法表满足所有这些条件。)

If there is a multiplication table that meets all these conditions, there are only three possibilities. The first possibility is real number system, which is n equals 0. The second possibility is complex number system, which is n equals 1, which has one cosine. The third possibility is quaternion, which has three cosine.（如果存在一个满足所有这些条件的乘法表，那么只有三种可能性。第一种可能性是实数系统，即 n 等于 0。第二种可能性是复数系统，即 n 等于1，它有一个 $\xi$。第三种可能性是四元数，它有三个 $\xi$。）

There is no other possibility. This theorem is not difficult to prove. This theorem was discovered in the early 20th century. It is not difficult to prove. I think anyone of you can understand this. It may take an hour.(没有其他可能性。这个定理不难证明。这个定理是在 20 世纪初发现的。证明起来并不困难。我认为你们任何人都能理解。可能需要一个小时。)

But it doesn't make sense for us to talk about this. But I can give you a simple example. You know what's going on here. For example, I'm going to prove it to you now. There are three possibilities. The first possibility is alpha, which is a plus xi plus yj.(但我们讨论这个没有意义。不过我可以给你举个简单的例子。你知道这里发生了什么。比如，我现在就向你证明。有三种可能性。第一种可能性是 alpha，即a加xi加yj。)

假设：$\alpha=a+xi+yj$，且 $i^2=-1, j^2=-1$

The second possibility is that the square root of i equals negative 1. The third possibility is that the square root of j equals negative 1. What is quaternion? It is a plus xi plus yj plus zk. Note that i, j, k are not the i, j, k I just mentioned. Those i, j, k are unit vectors.(第二种可能性是i的平方根等于负1。第三种可能性是j的平方根等于负1。什么是四元数？它是a加上xi加上yj加上zk。请注意，这里的i、j、k不是我刚才提到的i、j、k。那些i、j、k是单位向量。)

It's when you talk about vectors. It has nothing to do with that now. Quaternion is xi plus yj plus zk. And the square root of i, the square root of j, and the square root of k are equal to negative 1. So you're going to ask, can I get one less? I'm going to prove it to you very simply now. No, you can't. Why not? If there is such a thing, you must have an i, j. There must be an i, j in the multiplication table.(当你在谈论向量时，情况就不同了。现在它与向量无关。四元数是xi加上yj加上zk。i的平方根、j的平方根和k的平方根都等于负1。所以你会问，我能少一个吗？我现在就简单地证明给你看。不，你不能。为什么不能？如果有这样的东西，你必须有一个i，j。在乘法表中必须有一个i，j。)

The i, j must be a number in the system. So, for example, I write it as x plus yi plus zj. Since it's a system, it must look like this.(i和j必须是系统中的数字。因此，举例来说，我将其写成x加yi加zj。既然这是一个系统，它就必须是这样的。)

根据定义，可以将 $ij$ 写为：$ij=x+yi+zj$ 的形式

x, y, z are real numbers. Okay, I'm going to take this and multiply it by j. Multiply it by j. Then the left side becomes minus i. Because i, j, k are equal to negative 1. So it becomes minus i. This becomes xi plus yj minus z. The square root of j, k is equal to negative 1. I'm going to rewrite this. This becomes 0 equals xi plus y. I'm going to put in the i, j. This becomes x plus yi plus zj minus z. Okay, I'm going to put this project together.

Move the negative i to the right. Then it becomes yx minus z. This is the term without i and j. The term with i is x. Pardon? You said I did it wrong. Oh, I'm sorry.（x、y、z 是实数。好的，我要把这个乘以 j。乘以 j。然后左边变成负 i。因为 i、j、k 等于负 1。所以它变成负 i。这个变成 xi 加 yj 减 z。j 的平方根，k 等于负 1。我要重写这个。这个变成 0 等于 xi 加 y。我要把 i、j 放进去。这个变成 x 加 yi 加 zj 减 z。好的，我要把这个项目整合起来。）

上式再乘 $j$，得到 $-i = xj+yij-z$，然后把 $ij=x+yi+zj$ 代进来，即

$$-i = xj+y(x+yi+zj)-z$$
整理后：$$0=(yx-z)+(1+y^2)i+(x+yz)j$$
Is there anything wrong now? Negative i is equal to xj plus yij minus z. That's right now. So this i is equal to xj. So this is equal to yx minus z plus i. What is i? i is i times 1. 1 plus y squared. Then what about z? j is x plus yz. Is that right now? Okay. This must be equal to 0. It must be equal to 0 for every item.(现在有什么问题吗？负i等于xj加yij减z。现在就是这样。所以这个i等于xj。所以这个等于yx减z加i。i是什么？i是i乘以1。1加y的平方。那么z呢？j等于x加yz。现在是这样吗？好的。这个必须等于0。每一项都必须等于0。)

So in particular, y plus y squared is equal to 0. y is the real number. 1 plus y squared is not equal to 0. So it's a contradiction. So we've proved that three is not enough. If you have i and j, and every square is negative 1, then it can't be produced. Why is it possible to do cross-projection? There's a fourth one. i is equal to k. That's it.(因此，具体来说，y 加上 y 的平方等于 0。y 是一个实数。1 加上 y 的平方不等于 0。所以这是一个矛盾。因此，我们证明了三个是不够的。如果你有 i 和 j，且每个平方都是负 1，那么它就无法产生。为什么可以进行交叉投影呢？因为有第四个。i 等于 k。就是这样。)

$y$ 是实数，而要求 $1+y^2=0$，这不可能。

This is what Hamilton found on the bridge. He was very proud of it. He didn't understand at that time that this thing he invented was the only thing after complex numbers. So this is what I said last time. Why is this still... Hamilton has been around for almost 200 years now. At first, no one paid attention to this.（这就是汉密尔顿在桥上发现的东西。他对此非常自豪。当时他并不明白，他所发明的这个东西是继复数之后的唯一重大发现。正如我上次所说，为何时至今日...汉密尔顿已经存在近 200 年了。最初，根本没人关注这个。）

But in the 20th century, it turned out that the number system had a close relationship with physics. The first lesson is that you have to use complex numbers. Real numbers are not enough. I told you this last time. I once wrote an article. This article has been translated into Chinese.（但在20世纪，人们发现数字系统与物理学有着密切的关系。第一个教训是你必须使用复数。实数是不够的。我上次告诉过你们这一点。我曾经写过一篇文章。这篇文章已经被翻译成中文了。）

It's about Schrödinger. Schrödinger was an inventor of wave mechanics. He was forced to use complex numbers. Hamilton and Maxwell wanted to move quaternions into physics But it didn't work. It still doesn't work now. So if you want to study theoretical physics, most people think it's not going to work.（这是关于薛定谔的故事。薛定谔是波动力学的创始人之一。他被迫使用了复数。哈密顿和麦克斯韦曾试图将四元数引入物理学，但未能成功。时至今日，这种方法依然行不通。所以如果你想研究理论物理，大多数人认为这条路走不通。）

But a few people, including me, think it's a mystery. And I think that in the 21st century, perhaps, quaternions will be brought in in a very basic way. Why do I believe that? Because in the 20th century, symmetry is very important. And in this symmetry, there are some things that we don't understand. It's a very wonderful symmetry. So these symmetries and quaternions quaternions also have symmetries.（但包括我在内的少数人认为这是一个谜。我认为在21世纪，四元数或许会以一种非常基础的方式被引入。为什么我这么认为？因为在20世纪，对称性非常重要。而在这种对称性中，有些东西是我们尚未理解的。这是一种非常奇妙的对称性。这些对称性与四元数——四元数本身也具有对称性。）

Why do they have symmetries? There is an i, there is a j, there is a k. These three can rotate. It's not just that i becomes j, j becomes k, k becomes i. It can become a three-dimensional... You have three axes. i, j, k. Now i, j, k are three vectors. You can turn three vectors into linear combinations of each other, i prime, j prime, z prime, k prime. This is a rotation. This complex, this quaternion, its algebra is invariant under this rotation.（为什么它们具有对称性？有一个i，有一个j，有一个k。这三个可以旋转。不仅仅是i变成j，j变成k，k变成i。它可以变成一个三维的...你有三个轴。i，j，k。现在i，j，k是三个向量。你可以将三个向量相互转换为线性组合，i'，j'，k'。这就是旋转。这个复数，这个四元数，它的代数在这种旋转下是不变的。）

So this concept corresponds to some phenomena that we discovered in basic physics. So, it's easy to make you think that there may be a symmetry here. But this symmetry has not yet been discovered. This may have to wait until your generation. OK. It's canceled from 4 to 5 this afternoon. But tomorrow afternoon from 4 to 5, you can come to my office. OK, bye-bye. Thank you.（所以这个概念对应我们在基础物理学中发现的一些现象。因此，很容易让你认为这里可能存在某种对称性。但这种对称性尚未被发现。这可能需要等到你们这一代。好的。今天下午4点到5点的活动取消了。但明天下午4点到5点，你可以来我的办公室。好的，再见。谢谢。）
