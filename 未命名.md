## 一、单位

* 链式法则
* MKS 单位制，meter  kilogram   second
* 有效数字  $3.05 \neq 3.0500$，当我写下 3.05 时，意味着实际值介于 3.04 到 3.06 之间；而当我写下 3.0500 时，则代表实际值在 3.0501 到 3.0499 之间。换言之，当你记录一个物理量时，末位数字存在正负一的误差范围。
* 记住光速 $3.0 \times 10^{8}\, \text{m/s}$，更精确的值为 $2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$
* 在早期，秒是如何定义的？它是根据铯原子发射特定的这么多（9,192,631,770）周期来定义的。
* 米的定义又是什么？米是光在真空中在这么多秒的时间间隔内所经过的路径的长度。
* 质量的定义，强调的是质量不等同于重量，当你说某物重一公斤时，你指的是它的质量为一公斤。这与原子数量以及每个原子（包括电子）的质量总和有关，这就是质量。因此，质量是对物体总量的测量，而重量则是对力的测量。

## 二、直线运动

瞬时速度，它等于当时间间隔趋近于零时这个平均速度的极限。

《数学原理》对人类产生了巨大影响，因为它解释了所有行星围绕太阳的公转运动以及月球围绕地球的运动。但为了讨论例如地球绕太阳的运动，他知道必须处理两个球体：一个是巨大的太阳，另一个是较小的地球。

在他最初的计算中，他将太阳视为一个质点，一个较重的点，而将地球视为一个较轻的点，但两者都被简化为点状模型——一个微小质点绕着更重的中心点运转。但问题在于：太阳并非一个点，而是一个球体。因此他必须证明，在万有引力作用下，一大一小两个球体之间的引力作用所产生的运动规律，与将两者视为质点时的运动规律完全一致。

这需要用到积分运算，他花了 20 年（1687 出版）时间才完全确信这是正确的。但非常奇怪的是，当他撰写《自然哲学的数学原理》时，他并没有使用微分运算，也没有使用积分运算。整部《原理》都是用类似于欧几里得几何的语言写成的。

### 匀速和匀加速运动


（2. 10min）
When it goes upwards, if you extend it downwards, I have introduced a new concept to you. The speed can be positive or negative. If I extend it outwards, extend it inwards, if I throw a ball, it will go upwards.

In the beginning, dy dt is one meter per second.

Obviously, it is getting slower and slower. So the picture is like this. We will discuss this in the future.

Do you know this line? This Y, a ball is thrown up. This is T. Do you know what is the name of this line? It is called the bubble line. Parabola.

We will talk about this later. So I want to tell you that when it is here, its speed is positive. Its dx dt is positive.

At this point, its dx dt is zero. At this point, its dx dt is negative. Its instantaneous speed is positive here.

It is zero here. It is negative here. Actually, you can understand it at a glance.

When it goes up, its instantaneous speed is positive. At this point, when it is flat, its instantaneous speed is zero. At this point, its instantaneous speed is negative.

You must be able to understand it to a degree that you know it at a glance. If I don't plot Y now, I plot its speed, its dy dt. Its instantaneous speed.

Its instantaneous speed, its dy dt, is one. At t equals zero, at t equals zero, its speed is one meter per second. But later on, it goes slower and slower.

At this point, its speed becomes zero. From this point to this point, it goes slower and slower. If you want to plot it, it is like this.

If you throw something away, its dy dt is a straight line. This is called constant acceleration. What is constant acceleration? At each point, there is a position.

This is the position. This is the speed. The one below is acceleration.

The relation between speed and position is that speed is dy dt. The relation between acceleration and speed is that acceleration is dy dt. Speed is the derivative of position.

Acceleration is the derivative of speed. Does everyone understand this? Yes. Is there anyone who doesn't understand? If you have a little problem with this, after the class, find a student who understands and explain it to you.

This is the most basic concept. You have to become intuitive with this concept. At each point, its instantaneous velocity is dy dt.

In fact, what I am telling you now is the most basic concept of calculus. If this motion is like this, at this point, its velocity is between this point and this point. What is its average velocity? Okay.

This is delta t. This is delta x. At this point, it is delta y. From here to here, the time is delta t because this is t. If it goes up, this is delta y. So its average velocity is delta y divided by delta t. What does this mean? If I draw a straight line here and it becomes a triangle. This triangle has this angle. This angle is called theta.

This straight triangle, this side is delta y, this side is delta t. This angle is theta. So what is the relationship between delta y and delta t? What is the relationship with theta? It is tangent. This is what you learned in the triangle.

So if you draw a straight line, this angle is tangent theta. Okay. If I don't move this point and reduce this delta t, if I reduce it, I can't draw it clearly.

The triangle is enlarged. If I reduce it, for example, if delta t is half, then it comes here. So it becomes like this.

If I try my best to reduce it to the end, I am asking a question. What does this line become? It is called tangent. What does tangent mean? If you draw this line, the further you go, the closer it becomes.

In the end, it becomes a tangent. So what is the limit of this? So, dy dt is equal to what? It is equal to tangent of which angle? It is the tangent of which angle? It is the tangent of which angle? Because this theta becomes the tangent. This concept, tangent of the angle between the tangent and the T-axis, this whole tangent is called slope.

Why is it called slope? What does slope mean? Is it the slope? What is it in Chinese? Is it called slope? I use the word slope. If you go up a slope, that slope is called slope. The word slope in the order is tangent.

So if you see a line, draw this line, there is a curve at that point. The curve is the direction it is going at that time. The tangent between the t-axis and the curve is the derivative at that point.

After you understand this, you will know that the movement is here. Because its theta is 20 degrees. If you go here, the theta becomes smaller, so the tangent becomes smaller.

If you go here, the tangent is like this. If the tangent is like this, the theta becomes zero. So the tangent of theta is zero.

So at this point, the slope is zero. At this point, the slope becomes negative. Because the angle is going to the bottom.

So the theta becomes negative. So in fact, the concept of derivative is very simple. If there is a curve, the slope goes up at this point, so it is positive.

Its slope is positive. At this point, the slope is zero. At this point, the slope is negative.

At this point, the slope is zero. This slope is positive. This slope is zero.

It is negative. It is zero. And so on.

So you understand this. So this is the picture of location. The picture of location versus time.

This is its speed. So the speed at this point is positive. So it is positive.

At this point, the speed is zero. At this point, the speed becomes negative. So dy dt is the slope of this thing.

The slope of this thing is always the same. Because its tangent is always in the same direction. So dy dt is a negative number.

And it is a fixed number. So it does not change for time. So the acceleration is this picture.

Do you understand the three pictures I just mentioned? If you don't understand this, I suggest that you find a classmate who will definitely understand. Before Galileo, everyone was not clear about the speed of a falling object. Why was it not clear at that time? For example, everyone knows that Galileo put down two things from the top of the Pisa tower.

One is heavy and the other is light. This is true. So you have to ask if the two things fall to the bottom at the same time.

So before that, I think everyone outside China has an impression that the heavy object falls to the ground first and the light object falls to the ground later. It proves that it is not true. The two things fall to the ground at the same time.

So why did it have a wrong impression before? Someone will answer this question. No. Why did you have an impression that the heavy object fell to the ground first and the light object fell to the ground later? Because of the resistance of the air.

Because of the resistance of the air, if you use a very light object, if you use a very light balloon, it will fall very slowly. So of course it will fall to the ground later. So in the past, we didn't know the effect of the resistance of the air.

What Galileo did was that he used two different weights but they were both quite heavy. So the resistance of the air was not an important factor in his experiment. In this case, he proved that the two things fell to the ground at the same time.

So he proved that if the resistance of the air was not important, the object that fell to the ground would look like this. If you draw it as a position, it would be a parabola. If you draw it as a speed, it would be a constant speed.

If you draw it as an acceleration, the acceleration would be a constant negative number. This was discovered only after Galileo. Today, of course, it is very easy to do this experiment.

Because at that time, measuring time was quite complicated. Usually, if you want to put a ball on the ground, it will fall to the ground in a very short time, so it is very difficult to measure. Today, with a very simple method, you can measure it very accurately and you will know that the acceleration is indeed a constant.

And the number of accelerations, you have to look at the book and remember this number. Because this number is a very important number. Below, I want to talk about the rate, the rate of acceleration.

We need to discuss the rate of acceleration. Uniform acceleration motion. If at the beginning, its speed is V0, original velocity.

But, uniform acceleration means that for every unit of time, the velocity is increased by a certain amount, a. a is equal to uniform acceleration. Uniform means that it is uniform. Okay.

Now, if the original velocity is V0, what is the velocity after one second? What is the velocity after two seconds? Therefore, the velocity after T seconds is, you might say that is the definition. This is the definition of uniform acceleration motion. That is to say, the original velocity is V0, the final velocity is V, the final velocity is V, then the final velocity is equal to V0 plus a times T. This is the, you might say this is the definition of uniform motion.

Okay. Do we know what is the distance traveled? What is the distance traveled in T? The distance traveled is X. I will not talk about Y now. I will talk about X. X minus X0.

X0 is the original position. X is the later position. So X minus X0 is the distance traveled during the period P. This is easy to calculate because the initial velocity is V0.

Final velocity is V0 plus a times T. This is initial velocity. This is final velocity. So what is the average velocity? Average velocity is the average of these two numbers.

So it's V0 plus V0 plus a times T divided by two. That's average velocity. Average velocity times the time is the distance traveled.

Therefore, the distance traveled is equal to T times this quantity, which therefore is equal to... Does everybody understand what we just did? So now there are two important formulas. This is one formula. This is another formula.

This formula gives you the final velocity. This formula gives you the distance traveled. This may sound very simple, but actually we have made an assumption.

The assumption is that it's a uniform acceleration. If it were not a uniform acceleration, this average velocity calculation is not correct. The reason that... No, the average velocity is always this.

The average velocity is always equal to... The average velocity... Can somebody tell me? If it were not a uniform acceleration, which step I just mentioned is incorrect? OK, let's review. If it were not a uniform velocity, and not a uniform acceleration, then this formula is incorrect. Because this formula is the definition of a uniform acceleration.

So this formula is incorrect from the beginning. And this formula is also incorrect. But the spirit of this formula says that the initial velocity plus the final velocity is divided by 2, which is the average velocity.

Is this correct? Who agrees that it's correct? Who disagrees that it's incorrect? It's incorrect. It's incorrect. Because... Anyway, if you think it's incorrect, then it's correct.

Because it's a uniform acceleration, that's why it's correct. That's why there is this formula. OK.

OK. For the following questions, so that you know whether you understand or not, I will give you a question. This question is... Use these two formulas.

There are two formulas in the square. Use these two formulas to prove. Prove that it's V2 minus V02.

With these two formulas, it's easy for you to prove this. You don't need to teach this topic. But if you do this exercise, you would understand the thing better.

I think we are going faster than I originally thought we would go. So I will see whether you... The exercises that you are going to handle next Monday. Prove that you have no problem.

If the exercise next Monday is not good, then we have to find another way. If it's good, then I think we can continue at this speed. In fact, there is little content in this book.

If you know the source of the two formulas I just mentioned, and you know how to apply them, then you basically know everything in the second chapter. As I said before, at the end of every chapter, there is a review and summary. You should take a look at the review and summary.

If you want to know if you fully understand that chapter, you should take a look at the review and summary. I hope as time goes on, you will understand my English better and better. As I said, these days English becomes a sort of an international language for science.

So it would be very important for you to brush up your English as fast as possible. I have my office hours on the syllabus. Professor Ruan and Professor An also have their office hours.

So if you have any questions, you can come to us. Okay, good luck. 9.8 meters per second square.

I wrote a minus sign in front. If you take the axis to go upwards, if you take the axis to go downwards, of course it becomes a plus sign. So today we'll move on to vectors.

In the handout I distributed to you, if you look at it, there is at the bottom, notes. I specifically talked about vectors. The concept of vectors is a very important concept.

This concept was not particularly noticed before Maxwell. I'll read the notes to you. James Clerk Maxwell was the first physicist to emphasize the importance of vectors.

The following diagram was from a paper he wrote called On the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. You see the three diagrams there? On the left is convergence. Convergence means positive.

The one in the middle is called curve. The one on the right is called convergence and curve. The term curve is still used today.

It is a very important concept. Today's symbol is a triangular cross. Can this be abbreviated? Can this word be abbreviated? Let's talk about it next time.

Convergence is no longer used today. Now the name is called divergence, which is the opposite of it. So at the beginning of Maxwell, we already knew that
