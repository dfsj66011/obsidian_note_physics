## 一、单位

* 链式法则
* MKS 单位制，meter  kilogram   second
* 有效数字  $3.05 \neq 3.0500$，当我写下 3.05 时，意味着实际值介于 3.04 到 3.06 之间；而当我写下 3.0500 时，则代表实际值在 3.0501 到 3.0499 之间。换言之，当你记录一个物理量时，末位数字存在正负一的误差范围。
* 记住光速 $3.0 \times 10^{8}\, \text{m/s}$，更精确的值为 $2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$
* 在早期，秒是如何定义的？它是根据铯原子发射特定的这么多（9,192,631,770）周期来定义的。
* 米的定义又是什么？米是光在真空中在这么多秒的时间间隔内所经过的路径的长度。
* 质量的定义，强调的是质量不等同于重量，当你说某物重一公斤时，你指的是它的质量为一公斤。这与原子数量以及每个原子（包括电子）的质量总和有关，这就是质量。因此，质量是对物体总量的测量，而重量则是对力的测量。

## 二、直线运动

瞬时速度，它等于当时间间隔趋近于零时这个平均速度的极限。

《数学原理》对人类产生了巨大影响，因为它解释了所有行星围绕太阳的公转运动以及月球围绕地球的运动。但为了讨论例如地球绕太阳的运动，他知道必须处理两个球体：一个是巨大的太阳，另一个是较小的地球。

在他最初的计算中，他将太阳视为一个质点，一个较重的点，而将地球视为一个较轻的点，但两者都被简化为点状模型——一个微小质点绕着更重的中心点运转。但问题在于：太阳并非一个点，而是一个球体。因此他必须证明，在万有引力作用下，一大一小两个球体之间的引力作用所产生的运动规律，与将两者视为质点时的运动规律完全一致。

这需要用到积分运算，他花了 20 年（1687 出版）时间才完全确信这是正确的。但非常奇怪的是，当他撰写《自然哲学的数学原理》时，他并没有使用微分运算，也没有使用积分运算。整部《原理》都是用类似于欧几里得几何的语言写成的。

### 匀速和匀加速运动

重要的是搞懂 位移-时间图（抛物线）；速度-时间图（斜线）；加速度-时间图（恒等水平线）


## 三、向量

麦克斯韦特别强调了向量的重要性，但它的麦克斯韦方程式中使用的都是分量形式，并没有使用向量符号，很不好看。吉布斯（Gibbs）是一位美国物理学家。他无疑是 19 世纪最伟大的美国物理学家。或许与麦克斯韦相比，他会被归类为 19 世纪最重要的物理学家之一。他在耶鲁任教时，强调了向量的重要性。

麦克斯韦并未使用矢量符号，因为他希望超越矢量，引入了一种更高级的数学量——四元数，这是由W·R·哈密顿于 1843 年发明的。哈密顿是一位伟大的数学家和物理学家。如果你阅读更高级的物理学内容，就会知道哈密顿-雅可比方程对量子力学的发展做出了巨大贡献。

1853 年，哈密尔顿提出了一种数学结构，并将其命名为四元数。他对四元数的发明感到非常自豪。于是，在他去世后，人们在他生前常走的一座桥上发现了四元数。如今，这座桥的柱子上刻着四元数的代数公式。

麦克斯韦非常钦佩汉密尔顿，也非常喜欢四元数。所以麦克斯韦觉得矢量还不够。他应该用四元数来表示整个物理学。于是他改用四元数。出于这个原因，他觉得向量还不够。他想进一步研究四元数，但未能取得进展。所以他没有把它打印出来。他也没有用矢量符号在文章中写下来。所以今天我们看到了一个现象。他的文章和著作都采用了分量表示法，而非矢量表示法。

因此，后面受吉布斯影响，吉布斯不再使用四元数，而是使用向量表示法。因此，四元数逐渐发展，直到今天的向量表示法。那么，四元数应该被遗忘吗？关于这一点，有一个非常复杂的故事。这是我要讲述的故事。关于四元数和哈密顿的一些评论，请参阅我 1983 年出版的论文选集第 23 页。有一条关于四元数和哈密顿的评论。我要谈谈这个。物理学中的数字系统。

在物理学中，我们讨论的量都是用实数来表示的。但直到 1926 年之前，物理学中只用实数。有人可能会说，在交流电中，如果你在中学学过交流电的方程，它使用了复数表示法。但在交流电理论中使用复数符号并非根本性的，只是为了数学上的便利。直到 1926 年，随着波动力学的建立，人们才清楚地认识到在量子力学中必须使用复数。所以在 1926 年，由于薛定谔的研究成果，人们清楚地认识到必须使用复数。你可以阅读我关于这段历史的论文。我有一篇文章已被翻译成中文。Page 636

在那篇文章中，我描述了薛定谔如何在 1926 年发现波动方程。他是如何发现必须使用复数的呢？复数在波动力学中是固有的，无法消除。交流电中使用的复数性质有所不同。

从实数到复数，这一概念最初是由数学家引入的。到了高斯时代，人们已经普遍认识到复数的存在是必然的。但在物理学中，直到 1926 年人们才意识到必须使用复数。然而当我们审视数字体系时，除了实数之外，还存在着复数。后来，四元数也被发现了。四元数是一种非常奇妙的代数。哈密尔顿最引以为豪的贡献就是他发现了四元数。麦克斯韦和哈密尔顿都曾试图将四元数应用于物理学中。

换句话说，从今天的角度来看，既然我们知道物理学必须从实数走向复数，一个自然而然的问题就是：我们是否应该进一步走向四元数？这仍然是一个未解之谜。但关于这个问题，如果你查阅我的《论文选集》第 23 页，我的结论是：四元数尚未被引入物理学领域。

虽然关于这个话题的文章很多，但都不太成功。不过我认为，在未来的 50 年里，这里的年轻人会发现四元数必须被引入物理学。

$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=|a||b|\cos \phi$

$\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = |a||b|\sin \phi$，是平行四边形的面积


希尔伯特，这位最伟大的数学家——或许与庞加莱并列为1900年前后最杰出的两位数学家——将其大部分精力都投入了数理逻辑的研究。但有人知道后来数理逻辑领域发生了什么吗？希尔伯特的纲领被一位年轻的博士生证明是不可能实现的。你们听说过这个人的名字吗？很好。

我认为哥德尔不仅是史上最伟大的数理逻辑学家，更必须承认他是人类思想史上最伟大的思想家之一，因为他证明了希尔伯特计划——那种试图将全部数学按照欧几里得几何学风格体系化的构想——是不可能实现的。这一发现引发了数学思维方式的革命。

此后，一位名叫图灵的英国青年数论学家崭露头角。然后还有冯·诺伊曼。图灵和冯·诺伊曼从事的是数理逻辑的研究。这催生了现代计算机的诞生。当然，现代计算机的影响，我相信你们所有人都意识到了。冯·诺依曼和图灵都为此做出了重大贡献。

例如，图灵发明了通用计算机的概念。他所证明的是，所有现代计算机，只要每台都拥有无限内存，且不考虑时间因素，它们在功能上都是等价的。一台计算机能完成的任务，另一台计算机同样可以完成，他的计算机也不例外。他的电脑被称为图灵电脑。为了纪念他，国际上设立了一个名为图灵奖的奖项。这是软件理论领域的最高荣誉。

我很高兴，相信你们也会很高兴，得知姚期智教授，也就是 Andy Yao，现在已经成为清华大学的教授。他几年前获得了图灵奖，这相当于软件理论界的诺贝尔奖。这一切都遵循着一种关于数学逻辑和数字定义的推理。如果你沿着这个宏大的论证走下去，其中一个分支会引出实数、复数，然后下一个被称为四元数。这一点还可以进一步证明。这个证明虽然长但并不难。我相信只要详细解释，你们每个人都能理解。它们每一个都被称为一个可除代数。

除代数是一种类似于复数的代数结构。复数系统就是一个除代数，这意味着你可以在该系统内进行加、减、乘运算，并且可以除以任何非零数。对于实数系统而言，你当然可以进行加、减、乘运算，并且只要分母不为零，也可以进行除法运算。

复数具有相同的性质。因此，复数系统也是一个可除代数。已经证明存在第三种，且仅存在第三种，称为四元数。四元数系统包含一套数字体系，是复数概念的推广。在该系统中，只要分母不为零，就可以进行加、减、乘、除运算。

你可以证明没有更多了。但复数、实数和复数之间是有区别的，这与四元数形成对比。在复数中，乘法是可交换的。在复数系统中，a乘以b等于b乘以a。但在四元数系统中，a乘以b不等于b乘以a。因此，实数和复数在乘法上是可交换的。但是四元数在乘法中是不可交换的。在物理学中，最初每次你想乘两个量时，因为它们都是实数或复数，所以是可交换的。

但随着量子力学的发展，我们现在知道量子力学的基础是非交换代数。因此，在量子力学发展起来后，物理学家们意识到，你不仅需要使用实数，还必须使用复数。你不仅要处理可交换的代数，还必须处理非交换的代数。

因此，人们更容易接受这样一种观点：或许我们今天使用的数字体系需要进一步扩展。既然我已经向你们介绍了这么多关于四元数的内容，我想我应该再详细讲解一下，尤其是我们还有一些时间。复数体系处理的是 $a+bi$ 的形式。

四元数系统处理的是 $a+bi+cj+dk$。它有三个虚数单位：i、j、k。其乘法规则为 $i$ 的平方等于 $j$ 的平方等于 $k$ 的平方等于负一。ixj=k，jxi=-k，以此类推。这就定义了四元数代数。现在你已经知道如何进行加法和乘法运算。但问题是如何进行除法运算。

定理是这样的。q 的逆，是这样一个数，无论在前或在后与 q 相乘，结果都等于一。这与复数的情况非常相似。

对于复数来说，一个复数的逆等于该复数的共轭复数除以其绝对值的平方。这只是一个推广。你可能会问，为什么哈密顿只选择了 i、j、k？为什么不只用 i、j？为什么不选择 i、j、k、l？这些都是需要证明的。

$q^{-1} = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}(a-bi-cj-dk)$

例如，事实证明，如果你试图切断并发明一些关于 i 和 j 的乘法规则，你可以证明这是行不通的。只有当你拥有三个虚数，并且这三个虚数满足这一规则时，这才构成一个可除代数。这是一个优美的定理，但并非由汉密尔顿所证明。

哈密尔顿只发明了这种代数并证明了可以进行除法运算。但后来人们发现，如果想要得到一个可除代数，实际上只有三种可能：实数、复数和四元数。关于为什么有人希望或期待四元数能应用于物理学，我无法向你提供详细解释，但如果你阅读我的论文选集，我记得在第 23 页，我对此有一些评论。


--------------



So it's equal to v zero times square root of 2h over g. It is equal to fifty-five point zero meters times the square root of 2 times 500 meters divided by 9.78 meters per second squared.

I now want to give you two rules. First, do not substitute, do not use numbers until the end. Do not use numbers until the end. 

This is a trick. The deal is check the dimension. What is check the dimension? First, look at this. 

There is a meter here. This meter is eliminated. This second squared is at the bottom of the molecule, so it becomes second squared. 

Second squared is at the beginning. Oh, I got this wrong. This is fifty-five point zero meters per second. 

Second squared is at the bottom of the molecule, so it becomes a meter. So it's right. If you get to this point, it's easy to check. 

If this check is wrong, then your formula is a little wrong. If you use these two, it's easy to calculate. Does everybody understand the two rules that I mentioned? Especially during examination, you are under pressure. 

Do not put in the numbers until the very end. If you put in numbers, you are likely to make mistakes, and then the mistakes would compound itself so that eventually you would have a paper which is very messy and wrong. Next, we'll talk about the circular motion, uniform circular motion.

I was in a boarding school in Tsinghua Park. The school is still there, but now it's a union or something. It's on the west side of the second school gate. 

Then I finished elementary school there and went to Chongde Middle School. It's in the city. Now it's Rongxiang Hutong No. 

21. I studied there for four years. I finished my first year of high school and then the war began. 

In my second year of high school, I went to two schools, first in Hefei and then in Kunming. So I didn't study physics in high school. I studied a little bit of physics in junior high school, but I didn't discuss uniform circular motion.

In my second year of high school, I didn't study physics in junior high school. Then in the summer of 1938, I finished my second year of high school. The Ministry of Education said that there were too many middle school students, so they didn't want to study in uniform circular motion. 

So I decided to take the college entrance exam. In the entrance exam, there was always physics, so I had to study physics myself. So I studied physics for a month. 

In this month, I found a textbook. I don't remember what kind of textbook it was. I studied it for a month and took the exam. 

This month had a decisive impact on my life. Why? Because when I applied for the college entrance exam, I was transferred to the Department of Chemistry. I found that physics was very interesting, so I decided to study physics. 

So as soon as I entered the college, I immediately transferred from the Department of Chemistry to the Department of Physics. Why do I think physics is very interesting? I still remember very clearly which concept made me change my mind about physics. It was the concept of uniform circular motion.

I used to have an intuition. I think you all have an intuition. Intuition.

When it comes to uniform circular motion, the most important thing is the tangent vector. I think a child would have this kind of intuition. But the book told me that the acceleration is not in that direction. 

It is perpendicular to it. Its velocity is like this. Its acceleration is like this. 

I found this very strange at the beginning. But when I understood it, I realized that if you sit in a car and the car is turning, the pressure you are under is perpendicular. So physics theory actually matches your experience.

I thought this was very interesting, so I changed my mind about physics. After thinking about this, I came to a conclusion. This conclusion is very important for you to study anything, especially physics. 

A person has all kinds of intuitions at any time. When you are young, you have an intuition to survive. Even a dog knows that the straight line is the shortest distance.

This is an intuition. So we have some intuitions. If you want to survive, you must have an intuition.

When you are learning something, sometimes the result is different from your intuition. I found that the acceleration is not in that direction. It is perpendicular to it.

When I first saw this, I thought it was different from my intuition. In this case, it is the most important thing to learn. You have to think about it clearly. 

You can't give up. If you think about it very clearly, you will change your intuition. Then you will have a more correct intuition.

In other words, you have to want to turn your new knowledge into your increased intuition at any time. This increased intuition is very important. A lot of my research work is about symmetry.

Symmetry is a very complicated concept. You have a mathematical formula. This is not enough.

You have to turn that mathematical formula into your intuition. The first time I learned about this was when I went to the United States to study at Chicago University. I learned from Taylor.

Taylor later became very famous because he was the father of the hydrogen bomb. Because he invented a trick in the American hydrogen bomb. After talking to him, I found that he was very good at the principle of symmetry.

But he didn't know what it was. Gradually, I found that his principle of symmetry was in his intuition. But his intuition could not turn it into a formula.

This gave me a very deep impression. In other words, learning, especially complex physics, has specific things and intuitions. These two have to complement each other.

If these two are not right, you have to sit down and think carefully. Why is your original intuition wrong? When you think about this clearly, you turn what you infer into your new intuition. Then you are one step closer.

This is a very important way to learn. If you can't figure it out, you can't just let it go. This won't work.

Because next time you have a similar situation, you won't go back on your words. The uniform circular motion, or acceleration motion, is actually very simple. Why? Because the magnitude of this acceleration... We have to prove this.

I'll write down the formula first. Magnitude is V squared over R. R is its radius, V is its velocity. Direction, towards center.

This is called centripetal. Centripetal acceleration. Centripetal is centripetal.

Centrifugal is centrifugal. There is a term called centrifugal force. Centrifugal force... You'd better forget this term.

Its acceleration is centripetal. This is centripetal. Centripetal acceleration.

Centrifugal force. We have to prove this formula. At this point, it has a velocity like this.

It's its tangent. At this point, it's still the same. The length of the velocity vector is the same.

But it has changed direction. For example, this is V prime. V prime is the V after this.

So, what is acceleration? It's delta V. We have to calculate acceleration. It's delta V over delta t. It's the average acceleration. Then you have to draw a... This is V. This is V prime.

This is delta V. So, average acceleration is equal to V prime minus V divided by delta t. V prime minus V is a small... Let me draw it bigger. This is V. This is V prime. This is delta V. This is theta.

Or delta theta. These two are perpendicular to each other. So, this is also delta theta.

What is delta theta? Its velocity is V. Its radius is r. So, V over r is the angular velocity. This angular velocity is used for radii.

So this is delta theta. So our average velocity, our average acceleration is equal to v prime minus v divided by delta theta times r. v prime minus v is a vector. This vector is a triangle. 

When this triangle collapses into a line, where is the direction of delta v? Of course it is perpendicular to v. So the first statement is, as delta t goes to zero, the triangle, this triangle, collapses. The delta v direction has a direction perpendicular to v, i.e. centripetal. This is the first statement about its direction.

The second statement is about its size. What is the size? What is the magnitude of v prime minus v? What is the length of delta v? What is the length of delta v? Of course you draw a line here. This is an equilateral triangle, so it is equal to half of two times.

What is half? It is v times sine of delta theta over two. Do you agree or not? Do you agree or not? This is two equilateral triangles. Each equilateral triangle has a length of two times v times sine of this angle.

The magnitude of the average velocity is equal to v over r delta theta times two times v times sine of delta theta over two. This is equal to v squared over r times two times sine of delta theta over two divided by delta theta. I write delta theta over two like this.

This quantity, sine of delta theta over two divided by delta theta over two. When delta theta becomes zero, it becomes one. So this becomes v squared over r. Here we use a formula.

The formula is sine of an angle phi divided by phi to approach one. We use this formula. If I don't make phi small, there is a more accurate formula.

Who knows this formula? Who knows what sine of phi is? Raise your hand if you know. What is it? Phi minus phi cubed divided by three factorial plus phi five times divided by five factorial. It is also in the appendix.

If you accept this formula, Newton would know. In fact, Newton knew it before. China has never developed a formula like this.

It has a close relationship with modern science that China has never developed. But if you accept this formula, when you divide this by phi, both sides are divided by phi, the first term is one. The rest is at least phi squared.

So when phi is very small, it is gone. So it becomes one. These two are very important formulas.

Okay, do we have a proof now? Let's think about what's going on. When something is doing a circle, the meaning of acceleration is how does the velocity change. The velocity now is in the tangent direction.

Later, the direction of the tangent is slightly inward. So there is a change in the middle. The direction of that change is positive in the end.

And its magnitude needs to go through this calculation. This calculation is very simple. This formula is very important.

As I said before, is there any problem with the circular motion? If it is a non-uniform motion, what will happen? If it moves faster and faster, you can imagine that it will happen. In addition to an acceleration in the direction of the tangent, there is also an acceleration in the direction of the tangent. The reason why there is no acceleration in the direction of the tangent is because its length is not increasing.

Let's change that a little bit. which Newton realized. So Newton studied how Earth goes around the Sun.

The acceleration is not uniform circular motion. So therefore, when you talk about that, you need an acceleration which both has a tangential component and a component perpendicular to the tangent. What we have done is a geometrical proof.

Now I want to do the same thing, but an algebraic proof of the same. Let's write the coordinates first. Let's assume that it's going through a motion like this.

Let us define omega. Omega is equal to angular velocity. So it's equal to V over R. Normally, in physics, the speed of the foot is written as omega.

This is x. This is y. So what is x equal to? x is equal to R cosine omega t. y is equal to R sine omega t. Let's calculate the velocity. It's dx dt. Who can differentiate cosine omega t? What's the derivative of cosine x? It's minus sine x. This is not cosine x. It's cosine omega t. So we have to use a chain rule.

If you haven't learned this, you will learn it in a few days. You have to make it an intuition. You don't have to think about it.

So it's equal to minus omega sine omega t. And what about dy dt? Is it equal to R or what? It's equal to R cosine omega t. Because the derivative of sine is equal to plus cosine. The derivative of cosine is equal to minus sine. Let me differentiate again.

d square x dt square is equal to minus R omega square cosine omega t. It's equal to d square y dt square is equal to minus R omega square R sine omega t. But what's the derivative of this? It's equal to... So d square x dt square is equal to minus omega square x d square y dt square is equal to minus omega square y. In other words, d square R dt square is equal to minus omega square R. So this is equal to... Omega square is V square over R square times R. Then you can write it as minus V square over R times R over R. What is R over R? It's the unit vector in the direction of R. What's the derivative of R over R? It's the unit vector in the direction of R. So this means that the acceleration is positive. The direction is positive. Its magnitude is V square over R. This is what we just proved by geometry.

Do you like geometry or algebra? The answer is you like both. It's one thing to like both. But as we said last time, each has its own advantages.

In fact, when it comes to complex things, you can like both. But in general, geometry is more intuitive. In addition, everyone who studies physics, theoretical physics, or mathematics has a preference.

Some people like geometry more. Some people like algebra more. You can't force it.

But people who like geometry should also know how algebra is done and vice versa. I've been talking for a long time. In fact, I think we've been talking for two and a half lectures.

There's nothing complicated. It's just that the Uniform Circular Motion is a little bit complicated. It's all very simple.

What I'm going to talk about is not in the lecture. Because I mentioned it last time. Maybe some people who are interested in this don't quite understand what I'm talking about.

I'll make it a little bit more detailed. I introduce a concept called Transfinite Numbers. It's infinite.

Usually two things are the same. For example, you say three biscuits are the same as three pens. What does that mean? If you analyze it carefully, it can become one-to-one correspondence.

You can arrange three biscuits into a row, and three pens into a row, and match them one by one. What's the advantage of this? Three biscuits can't match four pens. Four pens are more than three biscuits.

So we have an intuition. There is a concept that what is the same number, what is the same number, which one is bigger than the other. In the past, everyone just talked about this.

But in the 19th century, some people started to discuss what the Transfinite Numbers were. When you think about it, there are a lot of things you didn't think about when you didn't think about it before. For example, can all the odd numbers match all the even numbers? Of course.

Let's say n matches 2n. On the other side, I arrange n, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. On the other side, I arrange 2n, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Of course, they can match one by one.

So this proves that all the odd numbers are as many as all the even numbers. So when you use the concept of matching one by one to infinite numbers, a phenomenon occurs. Of course, all the even numbers are just half of all the even numbers.

But they can match one by one. In other words, when you use the concept of infinite numbers, some of them can match all the even numbers. So you can also say that they are as many as all the even numbers.

This is a big difference between the concept of infinite numbers and the concept of even numbers. This is a big difference between the concept of infinite numbers This is what the 19th century mathematicians started to think about. The question just now is not detailed enough.

In other words, all the even numbers can match all the even numbers. This is not detailed enough. In fact, all the even numbers or positive numbers Actually, positive numbers can also be taken into consideration.

Simply put, all positive fractions can be made into one-one correspondence with all integers, all positive integers. All positive fractions, that is, a over b, a and b are all positive integers. All positive fractions can be made into one-one correspondence with all positive integers.

Why can I say this? It's very simple. I write all the positive integers, all the positive fractions. This is 1 over 1, 1 over 2, 1 over 3, 1 over 4, 2 over 1, 2 over 2, 2 over 3, 2 over 4, 3 over 1, 3 over 2, 3 over 3, 3 over 4. In this way, we can write an infinite table.

All the positive integers and all the positive fractions can be made into one-one correspondence. In fact, one even number is more than one. How can I correspond all the positive integers? It's very easy.

I start from here. This is 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. There are many ways. In this way, you can go through the whole infinite table.

Isn't there one-to-one correspondence? In fact, you can make all the positive integers correspond to all the fractions more than once. In other words, you can make all the integers correspond to all the fractions. So we can say all positive integers are equal to all positive fractions.

It's very interesting. Why? If you take all the integers from 0 to 1, there are so many fractions. 1 over 2, 1 over 4. 1 over 2 is equal to 161 divided by 320.

It's very close to 1 over 2. You can be very close There are so many fractions. It's dense. If you put 0 and 1 here, all the fractions are dense everywhere.

No matter how many integers you take, there are so many fractions. How can they correspond to all the fractions? In other words, when it comes to infinite numbers, how many fractions correspond to It's totally different from common intuition. OK.

Let's prove a very simple thing. All real numbers are greater than all real numbers One more point. It's totally different from common intuition.

It's based on the concept of one-to-one correspondence. It's greater than all positive integers. In particular, all irrational numbers are greater than all real numbers.

This proof is very simple and very famous. I don't need to prove all real numbers. I only need to prove all real numbers between 0 and 1. 0 and 1 are less than all real numbers.

But 0 and 1 are greater than all positive integers. This proof is very simple. If it's not true, it means all real numbers between 0 and 1 correspond to all positive integers.

Let me write it down. Otherwise, I can't prove all real numbers between 0 and 1. The first one corresponds to 1. The second one corresponds to 2. The third one corresponds to 3. All real numbers between 0 and 1 correspond to 1, 2, 3. This side is integer. This side is real number between 0 and 1. Now I can prove that the list on the right is incomplete.

Why is it incomplete? Let me take the first number. The first one corresponds to 1. The second one corresponds to 2. The third one corresponds to 3. The fourth one corresponds to 4. Let me change it. The first one corresponds to 1. The second one corresponds to 2. Now I know the real number between 0 and 1. The first one corresponds to 1. The second one corresponds to 2. The third one corresponds to 3. The fourth one corresponds to 4. The fifth one corresponds to 5. The fifth one corresponds to 3. This is a proof.

This kind of proof is often seen So what impression All the real numbers are infinite. But this infinite is less than all the real numbers. All the real numbers This is a complicated concept.

It is not a simple concept. As I said before, all the fractions are everywhere dense. But although it is infinite and if you think too much it is not too much.

It is just as much as all the real numbers. But if you add all the fractions it becomes all the real numbers. It is not the same as before.

So there is a problem. Between the real numbers and the positive integers is there any less than the real numbers? What is less than the real numbers? It cannot correspond to the real numbers but it can correspond to a part of the real numbers. But is there any less than all the integers? This is a very famous problem.

It is called Continuum Hypothesis. Continuum Hypothesis is whether there is an infinite number between all the integers all the integers and all the real numbers. I remember when I was studying at the University of New South Wales I heard about this.

It was a coincidence. So I thought about it but I could not figure it out. Now I think only an expert can figure it out.

This problem was solved by a mathematician called Paul Cohen in the 1960s. He proved that you can assume that there is an infinite number or an infinite number between these two integers. This logical system can develop without any internal contradictions.

But you can also assume that there is none. In other words, Continuum Hypothesis cannot be decided. In the current mathematical logical system it cannot be decided whether there is an infinite number or not.

It can be either there is an infinite number or not. Each of them creates a different mathematical conclusion.
