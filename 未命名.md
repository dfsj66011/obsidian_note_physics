瞬时速度，它等于当时间间隔趋近于零时这个平均速度的极限。


Principia Mathematica produced a tremendous impact on mankind because it explained the planetary motion of all the planets around the sun and the motion of the moon around the earth. But in order to discuss, for example, the motion of the earth around the sun, he knew he had to deal with two spheres. A big sphere, which is the sun, and a small sphere, which is the earth.

Now in his original calculation, he took the sun to be one point, a heavy point, and he took the earth to be a lighter point, but both of them are points, and one small point, the road going around, a heavier point. Then there's the question of, OK, but the sun is not a point, it's a sphere. So he had to prove that when you have universal gravitation, the universal gravitational force between a small sphere and a big sphere gives you a motion which is the same as if those two were just points.

This requires an integral calculus, and it took him 20 years before he completely satisfied himself that that was correct. But the thing which is very strange is that when he wrote the Principia Mathematica, he did not use differential calculus, he did not use integral calculus. The whole of Principia was written in terms of a language similar to Euclid's geometry.

I'm pretty sure in high school you have learned geometry, and that geometry follows the style of Euclid. You start with some axioms, then you have some propositions, then you have proofs, and you have corollaries, etc., etc. Newton patterned his big important book exactly like Euclid in this style.

Not only this, he tried to prove everything as if it's a geometrical problem. Because of that, for the last 20 or 30 years, very few people have really plowed through the whole book. Everybody knows it's a most important book, but it's too complicated, because if you do things with differential and integral calculus, it becomes very simple.

But if you don't use that and do it geometrically, it becomes very complicated. The great astrophysicist Chandrasekhar. Chandrasekhar was born around 1910, so he was some 10 or 11 years older than I am.

In his old age, he decided to understand precisely the geometrical arguments of Newton in the Principia. Chandrasekhar was very proud of this book. I didn't read it, but if you are interested, you could go to the library.

I'm sure the library has a copy of Chandrasekhar's modern interpretation of what Newton has done geometrically in the Principia. Leibniz was a German mathematician, and he was not so much a physicist like Newton was. He was more a pure mathematician.

And it is now believed that he independently invented differential and integral calculus. But he had correspondence with Newton, so there was great controversy about whether their discoveries were independent or not independent. And that became one of the great scholarly debates around the end of the 17th century.

In earlier centuries, before the 20th century, the biographers, all biographers, tend to only say good things about a famous name. For example, there were biographies of Newton. And in these biographies, Newton was a great man, and he was almost perfect.

But in the 20th century... By the way, that is more or less the kind of style of biographers in China in ancient times. But starting in the 20th century, there is a new movement of biographies in the West. There began a style in which one tries to paint the whole person.

And now there are many biographies which show that Newton, though a great scientist, was not a likable man. He was not a kind person. He was vindictive, and he was not a person who was well-liked.

And the controversy between him and Leibniz was one of the things that dominated the end of his life. If you go to the library, you can browse through some of the books which give details of the life of Newton. Now one of the controversies between Newton and Leibniz was what symbol to use for the derivative.

dx dt is the derivative of x with respect to t. That is the notation of Leibniz. It was not the notation of Newton. Newton did not use the word derivative.

Newton called it the fluxon. Today nobody uses the word fluxon. And the notation of Newton was very awkward, while this dx dt notation is very convenient.

So today everybody uses Leibniz notation. Okay, so we'll have a five-minute recess, and then we come in. Please have a seat.

I have a question. If you think you understand 80% of what I just said, please raise your hand. If you think you understand 80% of what I just said, please raise your hand.

So less than half of the people, less than half of the people can understand 80%. Okay, then I think I have to change a way. I mostly speak Chinese.

The proportion of English I speak is slowly increasing. But I mostly speak Chinese from the beginning. This is also a matter of habit.

And just now a classmate told me that he didn't understand. For example, 25.4 times 10 to the 2nd square is equal to 25.254. Does everyone understand this? Does everyone understand this? If you're not used to this, you'd better ask your classmates. This is very simple. 

You have to be familiar with this. For the average speed I just mentioned, For the average speed I just mentioned, I think everyone understands this. This average speed is the average speed in this section.

In the middle, there is another average speed. If this speed is uniform, then the average speed between big distances is the same as the average speed between small distances. But if it's not a uniform movement, then if you build a different interval, the average speed will be different.

If you make the interval infinitely small, it will become the instantaneous velocity at that time. These two points are very important. One is the average velocity, and the other is the instantaneous velocity.

An average velocity is a combination of many instantaneous velocities. We will discuss how to do this in the future. The notation of instantaneous velocity is dx dt.

The notation of instantaneous velocity is dx dt. I just talked for a long time. In fact, these two sentences are the main spirit.

In fact, these two sentences are the main spirit. Now we go to uniform or constant acceleration. Acceleration is acceleration.

We have to ask what acceleration is. Acceleration means that if a person goes from this point to this point, he will have an instantaneous velocity at every point. But the velocity must be the same.

For example, if a ball falls from the top to the bottom, we all know that it moves faster and faster. In the process of falling from the top to the bottom, its velocity is different at every point. It is getting faster and faster.

So I can ask, for example, what is the average velocity between the height of the ground and the height of the ground? What is its average velocity? It has a velocity. It has an average velocity. We already have the concept of average velocity and instantaneous velocity.

But if I draw it now, this side is x, this side is t. For example, this is t, one second, two seconds, three seconds. This is one meter, two meters, three meters. If there is a line, it is a straight line.

Can you tell me what are the characteristics of such a movement? It has a fixed instantaneous velocity. Why? Because it moves one meter in the first second, one meter in the second second, and one meter in the third second. So its movement is uniform.

In other words, it has no acceleration. Such a movement has no acceleration. What kind of movement has acceleration? It moves faster and faster.

So, for example, such a movement has acceleration. Why? Because it moves only a little distance in the first second. In the second second, it moves from here to here.

In the third second, it moves from here to here. In the second second, it moves from here to here. In the third second, it moves from here to here.

So its speed is getting faster and faster. So this is an acceleration. This kind of acceleration is called concave upwards.

Concave upwards. If it is like this, this is called concave downwards. If you move it like this every second, you will see that it moves in the first second, in the second second, in the third second, and in the fourth second.

It moves less and less. So its speed is decreasing. So, if you draw a line like this, if it is concave upwards, it is an acceleration movement.

If it is concave downwards, it is a deceleration movement. You have to pay attention to this. If you extend it like this, if you extend it like this, it doesn't move at all.

If you extend it like this, it moves downwards. If you extend it like this, This is still a deceleration movement. But its speed is increasing.

It moves one meter per second. Then it moves half a meter per second. Then it moves a quarter of a meter per second.

After a few seconds, it doesn't move at all. It doesn't move at all. It doesn't move at all.

If you extend it downwards, its speed becomes negative. This is a deceleration movement. Decreasing velocity.

Decreasing velocity is not only positive, it can also be negative. So, if you throw a ball, and it falls down, its speed goes downwards. Then it becomes more and more powerful.

When it goes upwards, if you extend it downwards, I have introduced a new concept to you. The speed can be positive or negative. If I extend it outwards, extend it inwards, if I throw a ball, it will go upwards.

In the beginning, dy dt is one meter per second.

Obviously, it is getting slower and slower. So the picture is like this. We will discuss this in the future.

Do you know this line? This Y, a ball is thrown up. This is T. Do you know what is the name of this line? It is called the bubble line. Parabola.

We will talk about this later. So I want to tell you that when it is here, its speed is positive. Its dx dt is positive.

At this point, its dx dt is zero. At this point, its dx dt is negative. Its instantaneous speed is positive here.

It is zero here. It is negative here. Actually, you can understand it at a glance.

When it goes up, its instantaneous speed is positive. At this point, when it is flat, its instantaneous speed is zero. At this point, its instantaneous speed is negative.

You must be able to understand it to a degree that you know it at a glance. If I don't plot Y now, I plot its speed, its dy dt. Its instantaneous speed.

Its instantaneous speed, its dy dt, is one. At t equals zero, at t equals zero, its speed is one meter per second. But later on, it goes slower and slower.

At this point, its speed becomes zero. From this point to this point, it goes slower and slower. If you want to plot it, it is like this.

If you throw something away, its dy dt is a straight line. This is called constant acceleration. What is constant acceleration? At each point, there is a position.

This is the position. This is the speed. The one below is acceleration.

The relation between speed and position is that speed is dy dt. The relation between acceleration and speed is that acceleration is dy dt. Speed is the derivative of position.

Acceleration is the derivative of speed. Does everyone understand this? Yes. Is there anyone who doesn't understand? If you have a little problem with this, after the class, find a student who understands and explain it to you.

This is the most basic concept. You have to become intuitive with this concept. At each point, its instantaneous velocity is dy dt.

In fact, what I am telling you now is the most basic concept of calculus. If this motion is like this, at this point, its velocity is between this point and this point. What is its average velocity? Okay.

This is delta t. This is delta x. At this point, it is delta y. From here to here, the time is delta t because this is t. If it goes up, this is delta y. So its average velocity is delta y divided by delta t. What does this mean? If I draw a straight line here and it becomes a triangle. This triangle has this angle. This angle is called theta.

This straight triangle, this side is delta y, this side is delta t. This angle is theta. So what is the relationship between delta y and delta t? What is the relationship with theta? It is tangent. This is what you learned in the triangle.

So if you draw a straight line, this angle is tangent theta. Okay. If I don't move this point and reduce this delta t, if I reduce it, I can't draw it clearly.

The triangle is enlarged. If I reduce it, for example, if delta t is half, then it comes here. So it becomes like this.

If I try my best to reduce it to the end, I am asking a question. What does this line become? It is called tangent. What does tangent mean? If you draw this line, the further you go, the closer it becomes.

In the end, it becomes a tangent. So what is the limit of this? So, dy dt is equal to what? It is equal to tangent of which angle? It is the tangent of which angle? It is the tangent of which angle? Because this theta becomes the tangent. This concept, tangent of the angle between the tangent and the T-axis, this whole tangent is called slope.

Why is it called slope? What does slope mean? Is it the slope? What is it in Chinese? Is it called slope? I use the word slope. If you go up a slope, that slope is called slope. The word slope in the order is tangent.

So if you see a line, draw this line, there is a curve at that point. The curve is the direction it is going at that time. The tangent between the t-axis and the curve is the derivative at that point.

After you understand this, you will know that the movement is here. Because its theta is 20 degrees. If you go here, the theta becomes smaller, so the tangent becomes smaller.

If you go here, the tangent is like this. If the tangent is like this, the theta becomes zero. So the tangent of theta is zero.

So at this point, the slope is zero. At this point, the slope becomes negative. Because the angle is going to the bottom.

So the theta becomes negative. So in fact, the concept of derivative is very simple. If there is a curve, the slope goes up at this point, so it is positive.

Its slope is positive. At this point, the slope is zero. At this point, the slope is negative.

At this point, the slope is zero. This slope is positive. This slope is zero.

It is negative. It is zero. And so on.

So you understand this. So this is the picture of location. The picture of location versus time.

This is its speed. So the speed at this point is positive. So it is positive.

At this point, the speed is zero. At this point, the speed becomes negative. So dy dt is the slope of this thing.

The slope of this thing is always the same. Because its tangent is always in the same direction. So dy dt is a negative number.

And it is a fixed number. So it does not change for time. So the acceleration is this picture.

Do you understand the three pictures I just mentioned? If you don't understand this, I suggest that you find a classmate who will definitely understand. Before Galileo, everyone was not clear about the speed of a falling object. Why was it not clear at that time? For example, everyone knows that Galileo put down two things from the top of the Pisa tower.

One is heavy and the other is light. This is true. So you have to ask if the two things fall to the bottom at the same time.

So before that, I think everyone outside China has an impression that the heavy object falls to the ground first and the light object falls to the ground later. It proves that it is not true. The two things fall to the ground at the same time.

So why did it have a wrong impression before? Someone will answer this question. No. Why did you have an impression that the heavy object fell to the ground first and the light object fell to the ground later? Because of the resistance of the air.

Because of the resistance of the air, if you use a very light object, if you use a very light balloon, it will fall very slowly. So of course it will fall to the ground later. So in the past, we didn't know the effect of the resistance of the air.

What Galileo did was that he used two different weights but they were both quite heavy. So the resistance of the air was not an important factor in his experiment. In this case, he proved that the two things fell to the ground at the same time.

So he proved that if the resistance of the air was not important, the object that fell to the ground would look like this. If you draw it as a position, it would be a parabola. If you draw it as a speed, it would be a constant speed.

If you draw it as an acceleration, the acceleration would be a constant negative number. This was discovered only after Galileo. Today, of course, it is very easy to do this experiment.

Because at that time, measuring time was quite complicated. Usually, if you want to put a ball on the ground, it will fall to the ground in a very short time, so it is very difficult to measure. Today, with a very simple method, you can measure it very accurately and you will know that the acceleration is indeed a constant.

And the number of accelerations, you have to look at the book and remember this number. Because this number is a very important number. Below, I want to talk about the rate, the rate of acceleration.

We need to discuss the rate of acceleration. Uniform acceleration motion. If at the beginning, its speed is V0, original velocity.

But, uniform acceleration means that for every unit of time, the velocity is increased by a certain amount, a. a is equal to uniform acceleration. Uniform means that it is uniform. Okay.

Now, if the original velocity is V0, what is the velocity after one second? What is the velocity after two seconds? Therefore, the velocity after T seconds is, you might say that is the definition. This is the definition of uniform acceleration motion. That is to say, the original velocity is V0, the final velocity is V, the final velocity is V, then the final velocity is equal to V0 plus a times T. This is the, you might say this is the definition of uniform motion.

Okay. Do we know what is the distance traveled? What is the distance traveled in T? The distance traveled is X. I will not talk about Y now. I will talk about X. X minus X0.

X0 is the original position. X is the later position. So X minus X0 is the distance traveled during the period P. This is easy to calculate because the initial velocity is V0.

Final velocity is V0 plus a times T. This is initial velocity. This is final velocity. So what is the average velocity? Average velocity is the average of these two numbers.

So it's V0 plus V0 plus a times T divided by two. That's average velocity. Average velocity times the time is the distance traveled.

Therefore, the distance traveled is equal to T times this quantity, which therefore is equal to... Does everybody understand what we just did? So now there are two important formulas. This is one formula. This is another formula.

This formula gives you the final velocity. This formula gives you the distance traveled. This may sound very simple, but actually we have made an assumption.

The assumption is that it's a uniform acceleration. If it were not a uniform acceleration, this average velocity calculation is not correct. The reason that... No, the average velocity is always this.

The average velocity is always equal to... The average velocity... Can somebody tell me? If it were not a uniform acceleration, which step I just mentioned is incorrect? OK, let's review. If it were not a uniform velocity, and not a uniform acceleration, then this formula is incorrect. Because this formula is the definition of a uniform acceleration.

So this formula is incorrect from the beginning. And this formula is also incorrect. But the spirit of this formula says that the initial velocity plus the final velocity is divided by 2, which is the average velocity.

Is this correct? Who agrees that it's correct? Who disagrees that it's incorrect? It's incorrect. It's incorrect. Because... Anyway, if you think it's incorrect, then it's correct.

Because it's a uniform acceleration, that's why it's correct. That's why there is this formula. OK.

OK. For the following questions, so that you know whether you understand or not, I will give you a question. This question is... Use these two formulas.

There are two formulas in the square. Use these two formulas to prove. Prove that it's V2 minus V02.

With these two formulas, it's easy for you to prove this. You don't need to teach this topic. But if you do this exercise, you would understand the thing better.

I think we are going faster than I originally thought we would go. So I will see whether you... The exercises that you are going to handle next Monday. Prove that you have no problem.

If the exercise next Monday is not good, then we have to find another way. If it's good, then I think we can continue at this speed. In fact, there is little content in this book.

If you know the source of the two formulas I just mentioned, and you know how to apply them, then you basically know everything in the second chapter. As I said before, at the end of every chapter, there is a review and summary. You should take a look at the review and summary.

If you want to know if you fully understand that chapter, you should take a look at the review and summary. I hope as time goes on, you will understand my English better and better. As I said, these days English becomes a sort of an international language for science.

So it would be very important for you to brush up your English as fast as possible. I have my office hours on the syllabus. Professor Ruan and Professor An also have their office hours.

So if you have any questions, you can come to us. Okay, good luck. 9.8 meters per second square.

I wrote a minus sign in front. If you take the axis to go upwards, if you take the axis to go downwards, of course it becomes a plus sign. So today we'll move on to vectors.

In the handout I distributed to you, if you look at it, there is at the bottom, notes. I specifically talked about vectors. The concept of vectors is a very important concept.

This concept was not particularly noticed before Maxwell. I'll read the notes to you. James Clerk Maxwell was the first physicist to emphasize the importance of vectors.

The following diagram was from a paper he wrote called On the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. You see the three diagrams there? On the left is convergence. Convergence means positive.

The one in the middle is called curve. The one on the right is called convergence and curve. The term curve is still used today.

It is a very important concept. Today's symbol is a triangular cross. Can this be abbreviated? Can this word be abbreviated? Let's talk about it next time.

Convergence is no longer used today. Now the name is called divergence, which is the opposite of it. So at the beginning of Maxwell, we already knew that
