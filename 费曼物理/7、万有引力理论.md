## 7–1、⾏星运动

在这⼀章中，我们将要讨论对⼈类智慧影响最为深远的通则之⼀的引⼒定律。当我们现在赞颂⼈类智慧的时候，应当先停下来向 *⼤⾃然* 表示敬畏之意，因为她能如此完整⽽普遍地遵循引⼒定律这样⼀个出奇地简单的原理。那么什么是引⼒定律呢？它指出，宇宙中每⼀个物体都以⼀定的⼒吸引着每⼀个其他物体，⽽对任何两个物体来说，这⼀⼒正⽐于每⼀个物体的质量，⽽反⽐于它们之间距离的平⽅。这个陈述数学上可以⽤下列式⼦来表示：$$\begin{equation*}
F=G\,\frac{mm'}{r^2}.
\end{equation*}$$如果对此再加上⼀个事实，即⼀个物体在⼒的作⽤下会沿着⼒的⽅向得到加速，⽽加速的快慢与物体的质量成反⽐；那么我们就已说出了所需要的⼀切，于是⼀个天资卓越的数学家就能推导出这两个原理的所有结论。然⽽由于你们还没有被认为天资如此卓越，所以我们要更详细地来讨论⼀下这些结论，⽽不是只给你们留下两个简单的原理。我们将简短地叙述⼀下发现引⼒定律的故事，讨论它的某些结果，它在历史上的作⽤，这样⼀条定律所遗留下来的神秘之处，以及爱因斯坦对这条定律所作的若⼲改进；我们还将讨论这条定律与物理学中其他定律的关系。所有这些不可能在这⼀章中都讲到，所以有些论题将在适当时候放到往后的⼏章中去讨论。

故事要从古⼈对⾏星在恒星中间运动的观察，并且最终作出了它们在围绕太阳运⾏的推论开始，这是后来为哥⽩尼所重新发现的⼀个事实。⾏星究竟 *怎样* 围绕太阳运⾏，并且究竟⽤ *什么样的运动* 绕之运⾏，要发现这些，就要稍微多作⼀点⼯作。15 世纪初叶，在⾏星到底是不是围绕太阳运⾏这个问题上曾有过剧烈的争论。第⾕·布拉赫（Tycho Brahe）有⼀个想法，它与古⼈提出的任何观点都不相同，他认为：如果能⾜够精确地测得⾏星在天空中实际的位置，那么这些有关⾏星运动本性的争论就会得到最好的解决。如果测量能精确地显示出⾏星在如何运动，那么或许有可能去建⽴这种或那种观点。这是⼀个⾮同⼩可的想法：如果要想发现什么东西，那么去细致地做⼀些实验要⽐展开冗长的哲学争辩好得多。在这个想法的指引下，第⾕·布拉赫在哥本哈根附近的希恩（Hven）岛上他的天⽂台⾥，花了多年时间来研究⾏星的位置。他编制了⼀种篇幅庞⼤的星表；在第⾕死后，数学家开普勒对这些星表进⾏了研究。从这些数据中，开普勒发现了涉及⾏星运动的⼀些⾮常优美、卓越⽽又简单的定律。

## 7–2、开普勒定律

开普勒⾸先发现，每个⾏星沿⼀条称为 *椭圆* 的曲线绕太阳运⾏，⽽太阳处在椭圆的⼀个焦点上。椭圆不仅仅是呈现为⼀个卵形的东西，⽽是⼀条⾮常独特和精确的曲线，这条曲线可以⽤两只图钉（在每个焦点上各钉⼀只），⼀段线和⼀⽀铅笔把它画出来；从数学观点上来看，它是这样⼀些点的轨迹，从两个定点（焦点）到其上每⼀点的距离之和是⼀个常数。或者，如果你们愿意的话，可以把它说成是⼀个“压扁”了的圆（图 7-1）。

![[f07-01_tc_big.png|240]]

**图 7–1：** 椭圆

开普勒的第⼆个发现是，⾏星并不以均匀速率绕太阳转动，⽽是当它们接近太阳时跑得较快，远离太阳时则跑得较慢。确切地说便是这样：设在任意相继的两个时间，⽐如说相隔为⼀周的时间内观察⼀个⾏星，并且对每个观察位置向⾏星画⼀条⽮径。那么⾏星在⼀周中所经过的轨道上⼀段弧线和两条⽮径⼀起围成⼀定的平⾯⾯积，犹如图 7-2 中所示的那个阴影⾯积。如果在离太阳较远的那部分轨道上（此时⾏星运动得较慢），也作时间相隔⼀周的与前类似的两次观察，那么这时围成的⾯积与前⼀情况下的⾯积完全相等。因此，按照开普勒第⼆定律，每个⾏星的轨道速率都使⽮径在相等时间内“扫过”相等的⾯积。

<p class="p">Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later;
this law is of a different category from the
other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates
one planet to another. This law says that when the orbital period and
orbit size of any two planets are compared, the periods are proportional
to the $3/2$&nbsp;power of the orbit size. In this statement the period is
the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit,
and the size is measured by the length of the greatest diameter of the
elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis. More simply, if
the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go
around the circle would be proportional to the $3/2$&nbsp;power of the
diameter (or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are:

开普勒第三定律发现得较晚；这条定律与前两条不同，各属于不同的范畴，因为它不是只涉及单独的⾏星，⽽涉及⼀个⾏星与其他⾏星之间的关系。这条定律表明：如果把任何两个⾏星的轨道周期和轨道⼤⼩进⾏⽐较，则周期与轨道⼤⼩的 $3/2$ 次⽅成正⽐。这⾥所说的周期是⾏星在其轨道上完全绕⼀圈所需的时间间隔，⽽所谓轨道的⼤⼩是⽤椭圆轨道最⼤直径（术语叫“长轴”）的长度来量度的。更简单⼀些，如果⾏星绕圆周运动（实际上确实近似如此），那么绕圆周⾛⼀圈所需的时间将正⽐于直径（或半径）的 $3/2$ 次⽅。这样，开普勒的三条定律便是：

<p class="p">While Kepler was discovering
these laws, Galileo was studying
the laws of motion. The problem was, what makes the planets go around?
(In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went
around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings
and driving the planets forward. You will see that this theory is now
modified! It turns out that in order to keep the planets going around,
the invisible angels must fly in a different direction and they have no
wings. Otherwise, it is a somewhat similar theory!)
Galileo discovered a very
remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding
these laws. That is the principle of <em class="emph">inertia</em>—if something is
moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go
on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (<em class="emph">Why</em>
does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)</p>
<p class="p blue-text">
当开普勒发现这些定律的时候，伽利略正在研究有关运动的定律。当时的问题在于是什么东西驱使⾏星在天上转动（那时有⼀种理论这样说，⾏星之所以运动是因为在它们背后有⼀群看不见的天使在扑动他们的翅膀，推动⾏星前进。你们将会看到，这个理论现在被修改了⼀下！这就是说，为了保持⾏星的环绕运动，看不见的天使们必须朝不同于运动的⽅向飞⾏，并且他们也没有翅膀。除此以外，这倒多少有点像现在的理论）。在有关运动⽅⾯，伽利略发现了⼀个⾮常值得注意的事实，这个事实对于理解开普勒定律是必不可少的。这就是惯性定律——如果有某个物体在运动，但没有和其他东西相碰撞，也完全不受任何⼲扰，那么它将沿⼀直线以均匀速度永远运动下去（为什么它能保持直线运动？我们不知道，但是事情就是如此）。
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Newton modified this idea, saying
that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use <em class="emph">force</em>.
If the body speeds up, a force has been applied <em class="emph">in the direction
    of motion</em>. On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new
<em class="emph">direction</em>, a force has been applied <em class="emph">sideways</em>.
Newton thus added the idea that a
force is needed to change the speed <em class="emph">or the direction</em> of motion of
a body. For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling
around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle. We have
to <em class="emph">pull</em> on the string. In fact, the law is that the acceleration
produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the
force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration. The more
massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given
acceleration. (The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the
end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the
same speed. In this way it is found that more or less force is required,
the more massive object requiring more force.) The brilliant idea
resulting from these considerations is that no <em class="emph">tangential</em> force
is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to fly
tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway.
If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a
<em class="emph">straight line</em>. But the actual motion deviates from the line on
which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation
being essentially <em class="emph">at right angles</em> to the motion, not in the
direction of the motion. In other words, because of the principle of
inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet
around the sun is not a force <em class="emph">around</em>
the sun but <em class="emph">toward</em>
the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the
angel, of course!)</p>
<p class="p blue-text">
⽜顿使这个观念更为明确。他说：“改变物体运动的唯⼀⽅法是要对之⽤⼒。”如果物体的速率变⼤，就必定有⼀个⼒施加在运动⽅向上。另⼀⽅⾯，如果物体的运动改变到另⼀个新的⽅向，那么它必定受到⼀个斜向的⼒的作⽤。这样⽜顿添进了如下⼀个观念：要改变⼀个物体运动的速率或⽅向，就需要有⼒才⾏。例如：把⼀块⽯⼦系在绳上，并使它作圆周运动，那么就需要有⼀个⼒以保持它在圆周上运⾏。这时我们必须把绳⼦拉住。事实上，这个定律说的是，⼒所产⽣的加速度反⽐于物体的质量；或者说，⼒正⽐于质量乘加速度。物体的质量越⼤，使它产⽣某⼀给定加速度所需的⼒就越⼤（质量可以这样来测量，使其他⽯⼦系于同⼀根绳的末端，使它们以同样的速率绕同样的圆周转动，⽤这种⽅法可以知道它们所需的⼒的⼤⼩，质量较⼤的物体，所需的⼒较⼤）。从这些考虑中得出的⼀个卓越的观念就是：要保持⾏星在它的轨道上运⾏，根本不需要有⼀个切向的⼒ （天使们并不⼀定要沿切线⽅向飞⾏），因为⾏星总会沿所要求的⽅向运动。如果根本没有什么东西去⼲扰它，那么⾏星就将沿直线运⾏下去。但实际的运动却偏离了不存在⼒作⽤时物体所应沿之运动的那条直线，这种偏离差不多与运动相垂直，⽽不沿运动的⽅向。换句话说，由惯性原理得知，控制⾏星绕太阳运动所需的⼒不是⼀个绕太阳⽽是指向太阳的⼒（如果有⼀个⼒指向太阳，那么当然太阳也许就是那天使了）。

<p class="p">From his better understanding of the theory of motion,
Newton appreciated that <em class="emph">the
    sun</em> could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion
of the planets. Newton proved to
himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very
fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise sign
post of the proposition that all deviations are precisely
<em class="emph">radial</em>—that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the
idea that all of the forces are directed exactly <em class="emph">toward the sun</em>.</p>
<p class="p blue-text">
⽜顿凭借他对运动定律的精辟理解，意识到太阳可能就是⽀配⾏星运动的那些⼒的源头所在。他给⾃⼰证明（或许我们不久也能证明），正是在相等时间内扫过相等⾯积这个事实成了所有偏离都沿径向这⼀命题的⼀个明确的标志——也就是说⾯积定律是所有的⼒都精确地指向太阳这⼀观点的直接结果。

<p class="p">Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the
farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at
different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that
the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the respective
distances. With the combination of the two laws,
Newton concluded that there must
be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line
between the two objects.

其次，对开普勒第三定律的分析可以表明，⾏星越远，作⽤⼒越弱。如果⽐较两个离太阳距离不同的⾏星，那么分析表明，⼒与⾏星各⾃的距离平⽅成反⽐。把这两条定律结合起来，⽜顿于是推断说，必定存在着⼀个⼒，它的⼤⼩反⽐于两个物体间距离的平⽅，⽅向则沿着它们间的连线。

<p class="p">Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities,
Newton supposed, of course, that
this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding
the planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter
had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the
earth, and Newton felt certain
that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the
force holding <em class="emph">us</em> on the earth, so he proposed that this was a
<em class="emph">universal</em> force—<em class="emph">that everything
pulls everything else</em>.</p>
<p class="p blue-text">
作为⼀个对事物普遍性有⾮凡感悟⼒的⼈，⽜顿当然要假设这个关系可以更普遍地加以应⽤，⽽不只限于太阳拉住⾏星这个事实。例如当时已经知道，正像⽉球绕着地球转动⼀样，⽊星也有⾃⼰的⽉球在绕着它转动，于是⽜顿确信，每个⾏星都在⽤⼀个⼒拉住⾃⼰的⽉球。⾄于把我们吸住在地⾯上的那个⼒，⽜顿也早已知道，所以，他就提出，这类⼒是⼀个普遍存在的⼒——每个物体都吸引任何其他物体。

<p class="p">The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the
“same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the
distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls $16$&nbsp;feet in
the first second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon
fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all.
But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight
line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really <em class="emph">falls in</em>
from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can
calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about
$240{,}000$&nbsp;miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth
(approximately $29$&nbsp;days), how far the moon moves in its orbit in
$1$&nbsp;second, and can then calculate how far it falls in one
second.<a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2" class="footnote-ref"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>
This distance turns out to be roughly&nbsp;$1/20$ of an
inch in a second. That fits very well with the inverse square law,
because the earth’s radius is $4000$&nbsp;miles, and if something which is
$4000$&nbsp;miles from the center of the earth falls $16$&nbsp;feet in a second,
something $240{,}000$&nbsp;miles, or $60$&nbsp;times as far away, should fall
only&nbsp;$1/3600$ of $16$&nbsp;feet, which also is roughly&nbsp;$1/20$ of an inch.
Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar
calculations, Newton made his
calculations very carefully and found a discrepancy so large that he
regarded the theory as contradicted by facts, and did not publish his
results. Six years later a new measurement of the size of the earth
showed that the astronomers had been using an incorrect distance to the
moon. When Newton heard of this,
he made the calculation again, with the corrected figures, and obtained
beautiful agreement.</p>

其次⼀个问题是，地球拉住⼈的⼒与它拉住⽉球的⼒是否“相同”，也就是说，是否都与距离平⽅成反⽐。如果地⾯上⼀个物体原来静⽌，然后释放，在第⼀秒钟内落下 $16$ ft，那么在同样时间内，⽉球将落下多远？我们也许会说，⽉球根本没有落下。但是如果没有⼒作⽤在⽉球上，它会沿⼀条直线离去，可是，它并不这样做⽽是沿⼀圆周运动，所以实际上它是从那个如果根本没有⼒作⽤时所应处的位置上落了下来。从⽉球的轨道半径（约 $240{,}000$ mi）以及它绕地球⼀圈所需的时间（约为 $29$ 天），可以算出⽉球在其轨道上每秒钟⾛了多远，随后就可以算出它在 $1$ s 内落下了多远。经过计算这段距离约为 $1/20$ in。它与反平⽅定律吻合得⾮常好，因为地球的半径是 $4000$ mi，⽽如果⼀个离地球中⼼ $4000$ mi 的物体在第⼀秒钟内落下 $16$ ft，那么⼀个在 $240{,}000$ mi，也就是在 $60$ 倍远的地⽅的物体应当只掉下 $16$ ft 的 $1/3600$，这个数值⼤约也为 $1/20$ in。为了⽤类似的计算来检验这个引⼒理论，⽜顿⾮常仔细地进⾏了他的计算，但是却发现差异很⼤，以致他认为这个理论与事实相⽭盾，因⽽没有发表他的结果。六年之后，⼀个对地球⼤⼩的新的测量表明，天⽂学家曾使⽤了⼀个不正确的到⽉球的距离。当⽜顿听到这个消息后，他就⽤正确的数据重新作了计算，所得的结果与事实⾮常⼀致。

<p class="p">This idea that the moon “falls” is somewhat confusing, because, as you
see, it does not come any <em class="emph">closer</em>. The idea is sufficiently
interesting to merit further explanation: the moon falls in the sense
that <em class="emph">it falls away from the straight line that it would pursue if
    there were no forces</em>. Let us take an example on the surface of the
earth. An object released near the earth’s surface will fall $16$&nbsp;feet
in the first second. An object shot out <em class="emph">horizontally</em> will also
fall $16$&nbsp;feet; even though it is moving horizontally, it still falls
the same $16$&nbsp;feet in the same time. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Ch7-F3" class="">7–3</a> shows an
apparatus which demonstrates this. On the horizontal track is a ball
which is going to be driven forward a little distance away. At the same
height is a ball which is going to fall vertically, and there is an
electrical switch arranged so that at the moment the first ball leaves
the track, the second ball is released. That they come to the same depth
at the same time is witnessed by the fact that they collide in midair.
An object like a bullet, shot horizontally, might go a long way in one
second—perhaps $2000$&nbsp;feet—but it will still fall $16$&nbsp;feet if it is
aimed horizontally. What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster?
Do not forget that the earth’s surface is curved. If we shoot it fast
enough, then when it falls $16$&nbsp;feet it may be at just the same height
above the ground as it was before. How can that be? It still falls, but
the earth curves away, so it falls “around” the earth. The question
is, how far does it have to go in one second so that the earth is
$16$&nbsp;feet below the horizon? In Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch7-F4" class="">7–4</a> we see the earth
with its $4000$-mile radius, and the tangential, straight line path that
the bullet would take if there were no force. Now, if we use one of
those wonderful theorems in geometry, which says that our tangent is the
mean proportional between the two parts of the diameter cut by an equal
chord, we see that the horizontal distance travelled is the mean
proportional between the $16$&nbsp;feet fallen and the $8000$-mile diameter
of the earth. The square root of&nbsp;$(16/5280)\times8000$ comes out very
close to $5$&nbsp;miles. Thus we see that if the bullet moves at $5$&nbsp;miles a
second, it then will continue to fall toward the earth at the same rate
of $16$&nbsp;feet each second, but will never get any closer because the
earth keeps curving away from it. Thus it was that Mr. Gagarin
maintained himself in space while going $25{,}000$&nbsp;miles around the
earth at approximately $5$&nbsp;miles per second. (He took a little longer
because he was a little higher.)</p>

⽉球“下落”的这种观念，多少有点使⼈迷惑，因为正像你们知道的那样，⽉球丝毫没有靠近地球。但是这个观念相当有意思，以致值得进⼀步加以说明：所谓⽉球下落，其含义就是：它离开了不存在⼒的作⽤时原应遵循的那条直线。让我们举地球表⾯上的⼀个例⼦。⼀个靠近地⾯的物体被释放后，在第⼀秒内将落下 $16$ ft。⼀个⽔平射出的物体也将落下 $16$ ft；即使它沿⽔平⽅向运动，但在同样时间内它仍然要落下 $16$ ft。图 7-3 表示⼀个⽤以演示这⼀情况的仪器装置。在轨道的⽔平部分有⼀个⼩球，它⾏将往前冲出⼀⼩段距离。在同⼀⾼度则有⼀个⾏将垂直下落的⼩球。另外，有⼀电动开关起
控制作⽤，在第⼀个⼩球离开轨道的时刻，它随即释放另⼀个⼩球。⾄于两个⼩球在同样时间内落下同样的⾼度可以⽤它们在半空中相碰撞这个事实来证明。⼀个物体（如⼦弹）被⽔平射出时，可能在 $1$ s 内要跑很长⼀段路程——⽐如说 $2000$ ft——但即使它是⽔平瞄准的，它仍然要落下 $16$ ft。然⽽，如果我们把⼦弹发射得越来越快，那么会发⽣什么情况呢？不要忘记，地球的表⾯是弯曲的。如果⼦弹发射得⾜够快，那么在落下 $16$ ft 后，它可能恰巧在地⾯之上与之前相同⾼度的地⽅。怎么会这样呢？⼦弹仍然在下落，但是由于地球向下弯曲，所以在“绕着”地球下落。问题是，它在 $1$ s 内必须跑多远才能使地球在⽔平线下⾯ $16$ ft？在图 7-4 中，我们看到⼀个半径为 $4000$ mi 的地球，以及⼀条在没有⼒作⽤的情况下⼦弹将循之⽽⾏的切向直线。如果我们现在应⽤⼏何学中⼀条奇妙的定理，即垂直于直径的半弦是所分割的直径两部分的⽐例中项，那么就可以看出，⼦弹所⾛的⽔平距离是所下落的距离 $16$ ft 与地球直径 $8000$ mi 的⽐例中项。$(16/5280)\times8000$ 的平⽅根很接近于 $5$ mi。于是我们看到，如果⼦弹每秒跑 $5$ mi，那么它将继续以同样的速度每秒往地球落下 $16$ ft，⽽决不会与之靠得更近⼀些，因为地球表⾯总是在不断地弯曲⽽离开⼦弹。加加林先⽣也是这样以每秒⼤约 $5$ mi 的速率绕地球飞⾏ $25000$ mi 来使⾃⼰保持在空间的（他绕地球⼀周所需的时间稍为长⼀些，因为他在稍为⾼⼀点的地⽅飞⾏）。

<p class="p">The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously
understood. For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the
tides, hitherto mysterious. The moon pulls the water up under it and
makes the tides—people had thought of that before, but they were not
as clever as Newton, and so they
thought there ought to be only one tide during the day. The reasoning
was that the moon pulls the water up under it, making a high tide and a
low tide, and since the earth spins underneath, that makes the tide at
one station go up and down every $24$&nbsp;hours. Actually the tide goes up
and down in $12$&nbsp;hours. Another school of thought claimed that the high
tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they argued,
the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both of these theories are
wrong. It actually works like this: the pull of the moon for the earth
and for the water is “balanced” at the center. But the water which is
closer to the moon is pulled <em class="emph">more</em> than the average and the water
which is farther away from it is pulled <em class="emph">less</em> than the average.
Furthermore, the water can flow while the more rigid earth cannot. The
true picture is a combination of these two things.</p>

引⼒定律解释了许多以前所不能理解的现象。例如，⽉球对地球的吸引造成了潮汐，直到那时为⽌还是⼀个谜。⽉球吸引地⾯的⽔造成潮汐——这在以前⼈们也想到过，但是他们不如⽜顿那样聪明，所以他们想，⼀昼夜应该只有⼀次潮汐。其理由是，⽉亮把地⾯的⽔提升上来，造成⼀个⾼潮和⼀个低潮。由于地球在⽉球下⾯旋转，就使⼀个地⽅的潮⽔每 $24$ h 涨落⼀次。实际情况是潮⽔每 $12$ h 涨落⼀次。另⼀个学派则主张，⾼潮应当在地球的另⼀⾯，他们争辩说，因为⽉球把地球从⽔中拉开！这两种理论都是错误的。实际的过程如下：⽉球对地球和对⽔的吸引在中⼼是“平衡”的。但是靠近⽉球的⽔被拉的程度要⽐平均值⼤，⽽离⽉球较远的⽔被拉的程度要⽐平均值⼩。此外，⽔能流动，⽽⽐较结实和坚硬的地球却不能。真实的情况是这两者的结合。

<p class="p">What do we mean by “balanced”? What balances? If the moon pulls the
whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the
moon? Because the earth does the same trick as the moon, it goes in a
circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center.
The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both
go around a central position, each falling toward this common position,
as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch7-F5" class="">7–5</a>. This motion around the common center
is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in a
straight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side
is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it
is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal
force.” The
result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the
center of the earth. On the near side, the attraction from the moon is
stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but
again <em class="emph">away</em> from the center of the earth. The net result is that

所谓“平衡”指的是什么意思呢？什么东西在平衡？如果⽉球把整个地球拉向⾃⼰，那么为什么地球不会“向上”落到⽉球上去？这是由于地球耍着像⽉球⼀样的花招，所以它在绕某点作圆周运动，这个点在地球内部，但不在地球中⼼。⽉球并不在绕地球中⼼转动，⽽是地球和⽉球⼀起在绕另⼀个中⼼位置转动，每⼀个都在向着这个共同位置下落，如图 7-5 所示。这个绕共同中⼼的运动，是使每⼀个的下落得以平衡的原因。因此，地球也不是沿⼀直线⾏⾛，⽽是在绕⼀个点作圆周转动。地球上离这点远的⼀边的⽔是“不平衡的”，因为该处⽉球的引⼒要⽐在地球中⼼处⼩，⽽在地球中⼼处这⼀引⼒刚好和“离⼼⼒”平衡，结果这⼀不平衡使⽔沿离开地球中⼼的正⽅向运动。在近的⼀边，⽉球的吸引较强，所以不平衡是在空中相反的⽅向上，但又是离开地球中⼼的。最后，我们得到了两次涨潮。

the earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to
gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because
everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself
together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not
<em class="emph">exactly</em> a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in
centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out that
the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the

be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation.

当我们理解引⼒的时候，还可以理解别的什么呢？⼈⼈都知道地球是圆的。为什么地球是圆的？这很容易回答：由于引⼒的作⽤。我们之所以能够理解地球是圆的，仅仅是因为每个物体都在吸引任何其他的物体，所以地球尽它之所能把⾃⾝各部分相互吸引在⼀块！如果我们进⼀步深⼊下去，那么地球并不是⼀个精确的圆球，因为它在旋转着，从⽽引进了离⼼效应，在靠近⾚道的地⽅，它趋向于与引⼒相对抗，其结果表明，地球应当是椭圆形的，⽽且我们甚⾄得到了这个椭圆的正确形状。这样，我们仅仅从引⼒定律出发，就能推论出太阳、⽉球和地球都应当呈（近似的）圆球形。

moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move
around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty
with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites
were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead
of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by
waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the
average for the moons to go around.) Now they were <em class="emph">ahead</em> when
Jupiter was particularly <em class="emph">close</em> to the earth and they were
<em class="emph">behind</em> when Jupiter was <em class="emph">farther</em> from the earth. This would
have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of

theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even
in <em class="emph">one place</em> where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason
for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little
while to <em class="emph">see</em> the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes
light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the
earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth,
the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a
little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to
or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not
travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of
light. This was done in&nbsp;1676.</p>

but there is <em class="emph">some</em> pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a
perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles”
around the correct elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little more
complicated. Attempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter,
Saturn, and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation. The effects
of each of these planets on each other were calculated to see whether or
not the tiny deviations and irregularities in these motions could be
completely understood from this one law. Lo and behold, for Jupiter and
Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was “weird.” It behaved in a very
peculiar manner. It was not travelling in an exact ellipse, but that was
understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn. But
even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus <em class="emph">still</em>
was not going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being

plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not

the same place. Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each
other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law.</p>

Although they look as if they are packed solid toward the center, that
is due to the fallibility of our instruments. Actually, the distances
between even the centermost stars are very great and they very rarely
collide. There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as
we move outward there are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is
an attraction among these stars. It is clear that gravitation exists at

我们不仅能够理解星云，⽽且从引⼒定律出发，甚⾄还能对恒星的起源获得某些概念。如果我们有很⼤的⼀⽚尘埃与⽓体云，如图 7-11 所示，那么尘埃⽚与⽚之间由引⼒⽽产⽣的吸引，可能会使它们形成⼀些⼩的团块。在图上有⼀些“⼩”⿊斑依稀可辨，它们可能是尘埃与⽓体相积聚的开始，⽽由于这些积聚物彼此间的引⼒作⽤，就开始形成星体。我们究竟是否看到过⼀个星的形成，这是⼀个可争论的问题。图 7-12 提供了⼀个证据说明我们曾经见到过。左边是⼀张 $1947$ 年拍摄的照⽚，显示⼀个⽓体区域，中间有⼏个星体；右边是⼀张只过了七年之后拍摄的照⽚，显示两个新的亮点。⽓体是不是积聚了起来，引⼒是不是作⽤得⾜够强，并把它聚集成⼀个⾜够⼤的球体，以致在其内部发⽣星体核反应⽽把它变为⼀颗星呢？或许是这样，或许不是这样。⽽不可思议的是，仅仅在七年之中我们竟会如此幸运，能看到⼀颗星体把本⾝转变为可见的形式；更不可能的是，我们居然⼀下⼦能看到了两个！

<p class="p">Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if there is
a force between <em class="emph">any</em> pair of objects, we ought to be able to
measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to watch
the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a
marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty
of this experiment when done in such a simple manner is the very
weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care,
which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it
is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured.
It was first measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch7-F13" class="">7–13</a>. This first demonstrated the direct force between
two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends
of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By
measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength
of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately
determine the coefficient&nbsp;$G$ in the formula</p>

<p class="p">Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is interesting
to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to
time. At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it,
but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered about
1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high
speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going
through matter. When they <em class="emph">are</em> absorbed, they give an impulse to
the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another,
the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles
coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer
of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side.
Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not
take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the
distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun
subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It
involves some new consequences which are <em class="emph">not true</em>. This
particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around
the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its
forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain
in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore
there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the
earth would feel a <em class="emph">resistance to motion</em> and would be slowing up
in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to
stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough
for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work.
No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without

引⼒的机制曾经屡次为⼈们所提出过。研究⼀下很多⼈⼀再想到的其中的⼀个，是颇饶趣味的。起初，当有⼈“发现”它的时候，确实⾮常⾼兴，感到⼗分幸运，但他随即发现原来这是错误的。这个机制⼤约在 1750 年第⼀次被⼈们提出。设想有许许多多粒⼦在空间以极⼤速度向各个⽅向运动，在它们穿过物质时只有很少⼀部分被吸收掉。当它们被吸收时，就给地球以⼀个冲量。然⽽，由于在⼀个⽅向上运动的粒⼦同在别的⽅向上运动的粒⼦⼀样多，所以这些冲量都互相抵消。但是如果考虑到太阳在地球附近，那么跑向地球的粒⼦穿过太阳时要被吸收⼀部分，所以来⾃太阳的粒⼦⽐来⾃另⼀边的粒⼦要少⼀些。因此，地球最后受到⼀个朝向太阳的冲量。⽽且，不要花费多少时间⼈们就能看出，这个冲量与距离平⽅成反⽐，因为当距离改变时，太阳所张的⽴体角也要改变。这个机制错在哪⾥呢？错在其中包括了⼀些新的结果，⽽这些新的结果是不真实的。这个特别的想法遇到了如下的困难：地球绕太阳运⾏时，它与从前⾯射来的粒⼦相碰撞的次数，将⽐从后⾯射来的粒⼦要多（当你在⾬中奔跑时，打在你脸上的⾬点要⽐打在你脑后的多）。因此从正⾯将会给予地球更⼤的冲⼒，⽽地球将会受到⼀种对其运动的阻⼒作⽤，这种阻⼒将使它在轨道上的运动减慢下来。⼈们可以算出，作为这种阻⼒的结果，地球需要多长时间才会停下来；结果是使地球仍留在轨道上的时间并不长，所以这个机制⾏不通。从此也就没有再提出过任何⼀个机制，它既能“解释”引⼒，又不⾄于会预⾔其他实际不存在的现象。

<p class="p">Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other
forces. There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces
at the present time. It is not an aspect of electricity or anything like
that, so we have no explanation. However, gravitation and other forces
are very similar, and it is interesting to note analogies. For example,
the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the
law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus
sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the
square of the distance. It is in the opposite direction—likes repel.
But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same
function of distance? Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more
closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify
them; the so-called unified field theory is only a very elegant attempt

其次我们要讨论万有引⼒与其他作⽤⼒之间可能存在的关系。⽬前还没有⼀种⽤其他⼒来说明引⼒的解释。它不是电或诸如此类的⼀个⽅⾯，所以我们⽆法解释。然⽽，引⼒与其他⼒⼗分相似，因⽽看⼀下它们的相似之处是很有趣的。例如，两个带电体之间的电⼒看上去就很像引⼒定律：它们之间的电⼒等于⼀个带负号的常数乘以电荷之积，并与距离的平⽅成反⽐。电⼒的⽅向则与引⼒的情况相反——同号相斥。但是两条定律含有同样的距离函数，这难道还不够引⼈注⽬吗？引⼒与电⼒之间的关系或许⽐我们所能想象的要密切得多。⼈们作了许多尝试企图把它们统⼀起来；所谓的统⼀场论，不过是⼀个想把电⼒与引⼒结合起来的⾮常美妙的尝试⽽已；但是如果把引⼒与电⼒相⽐较，那么最有趣的事是⼒的相对强度。任何⼀个包括它们两者的理论，必须也能推导出引⼒有多⼤。

ratio is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch7-F14" class="">7–14</a>. The gravitational attraction

If that were the case, the gravitational constant would change with
time, because as the universe got older the ratio of the age of the

one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same

the gravity is stronger for a given mass in <em class="emph">just the right

if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which

事实上，引力与质量成正比，⽽这种质量实际上就是惯性的⼀种量度，也就是当⼀个物体绕圆周运动时，要维持它在圆周上有多难的⼀种量度。因此，若有⼀轻⼀重两个物体，由于重⼒作⽤⽽绕⼀更⼤的物体沿同⼀个圆周以同样速度转动，那么它们总将保持在⼀起，因为要在圆周上运动就需要⼒，对⼤的质量，需要的⼒也⼤。这就是说：对于⼀个较重的物体，重⼒作⽤应当正好以恰当的⽐例增加，所以这两个物体仍将⼀起作圆周运动。如果⼀个物体原先在另⼀物体的⾥边，那么它将留在⾥边⽽不离开；这是⼀个完全的平衡状态。因此，加加林或季托夫发现宇宙飞船舱内的⼀切东西是“失重”的，⽐⽅说如果他们碰巧丢掉⼀⽀粉笔，那么粉笔将与整个宇宙飞船沿着⼀条完全⼀样的路径绕地球飞⾏，所以它将始终在空间悬浮于宇航员的眼前。⾮常有趣的是，重⼒以极⼤的精密度精确地与质量成正⽐，因为如果不是如此的话，将产⽣某种效应，其中惯性与重量会有所区别。这样⼀种效应实际上并不存在。关于这⼀点，⼈们曾以极⼤的精密度⽤实验验证过。厄特沃斯（Eötvös）在 $1909$ 年第⼀次进⾏了这种实验；⽽最近则由迪克（Dicke）做过。对于所有做过试验的材料，其结果是，质量与重量的正⽐关系精确到 $10^{-9}$ 或者更⼩。这是⼀个⾮凡的实验。

<p class="p">Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modification of
Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created,
Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modified by Einstein
to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the
gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a
mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of
that mass; by such means we could send signals at infinite speed.
Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we <em class="emph">cannot send
signals faster than the speed of light</em>, so the law of gravitation must
be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into account, we have a
new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new
law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein
relativity theory, anything which has
<em class="emph">energy</em> has mass—mass in the sense that it is attracted
gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a
light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an
attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is
deflected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which
are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if
the sun were not there, and this has been observed.</p>

另⼀个值得讨论的论题是爱因斯坦对⽜顿引⼒定律所作的修正。尽管⽜顿引⼒定律创造了所有这些惊⼈的成就，但仍然是不正确的！爱因斯坦对它所作的修正，在于把相对论考虑了进去。依照⽜顿的观点，引⼒效应是瞬时发⽣的，也就是说，如果我们移动⼀个物体，那么我们就会⽴即感觉到⼀个新的⼒，因为物体到达了新的位置；按照这种说法，我们可以以⽆穷⼤的速度发送信号。然⽽爱因斯坦提出了种种论证，说明我们不能发送⽐光更快的信号，所以⽜顿引⼒定律必定是错误的。在考虑到延迟情况⽽加以校正后，我们得到⼀条新的定律，称为爱因斯坦引⼒定律。这条⾮常容易理解的新定律的⼀个特点是：在爱因斯坦相对论中，任何具有能量的东西也具有质量——质量应在这⼀意义下来理解，即它以引⼒⽅式被其他质量所吸引。即使是光，由于它有能量，也就有“质量”。当⼀束带有能量的光经过太阳附近时，它将受到太阳的吸引。所以光并不是沿直线通过的，⽽是被弯曲了的。例如在⽇⾷时，太阳周围的恒星应该看起来好像从它们的这些位置偏离开去，这些位置就是如果太阳不在那⾥时它们所应处的地⽅。⽽⼈们也观察到了这个情况。

<p class="p">Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent years
we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that
there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc.
None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain

a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other

Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun, in precisely this way: Suppose a planet is observed at any two successive times, let us say a week apart, and that the radius vector[1](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#footnote_1) is drawn to the planet for each observed position. The orbital arc traversed by the planet during the week, and the two radius vectors, bound a certain plane area, the shaded area shown in Fig. [7–2](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F2). If two similar observations are made a week apart, at a part of the orbit farther from the sun (where the planet moves more slowly), the similarly bounded area is exactly the same as in the first case. So, in accordance with the second law, the orbital speed of each planet is such that the radius “sweeps out” equal areas in equal times.

![](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/img/FLP_I/f07-02/f07-02_tc_big.svgz)

Fig. 7–2.Kepler’s law of areas.

Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law is of a different category from the other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates one planet to another. This law says that when the orbital period and orbit size of any two planets are compared, the periods are proportional to the 3/23/2 power of the orbit size. In this statement the period is the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is measured by the length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis. More simply, if the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go around the circle would be proportional to the 3/23/2 power of the diameter (or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are:

1. Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.
2. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: T∝a3/2T∝a3/2.

### 7–3Development of dynamics

While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the laws of motion. The problem was, what makes the planets go around? (In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings and driving the planets forward. You will see that this theory is now modified! It turns out that in order to keep the planets going around, the invisible angels must fly in a different direction and they have no wings. Otherwise, it is a somewhat similar theory!) Galileo discovered a very remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding these laws. That is the principle of _inertia_—if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (_Why_ does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)

Newton modified this idea, saying that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use _force_. If the body speeds up, a force has been applied _in the direction of motion_. On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new _direction_, a force has been applied _sideways_. Newton thus added the idea that a force is needed to change the speed _or the direction_ of motion of a body. For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle. We have to _pull_ on the string. In fact, the law is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration. The more massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration. (The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the same speed. In this way it is found that more or less force is required, the more massive object requiring more force.) The brilliant idea resulting from these considerations is that no _tangential_ force is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to fly tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway. If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a _straight line_. But the actual motion deviates from the line on which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation being essentially _at right angles_ to the motion, not in the direction of the motion. In other words, because of the principle of inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is not a force _around_ the sun but _toward_ the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the angel, of course!)

### 7–4Newton’s law of gravitation

From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that _the sun_ could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets. Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise sign post of the proposition that all deviations are precisely _radial_—that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly _toward the sun_.

Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces. If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the respective distances. With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects.

Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, of course, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding the planets. It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force. He already knew of the force holding _us_ on the earth, so he proposed that this was a _universal_ force—_that everything pulls everything else_.

The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls 1616 feet in the first second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all. But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really _falls in_ from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about 240,000240,000 miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth (approximately 2929 days), how far the moon moves in its orbit in 11 second, and can then calculate how far it falls in one second.[2](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#footnote_2) This distance turns out to be roughly 1/201/20 of an inch in a second. That fits very well with the inverse square law, because the earth’s radius is 40004000 miles, and if something which is 40004000 miles from the center of the earth falls 1616 feet in a second, something 240,000240,000 miles, or 6060 times as far away, should fall only 1/36001/3600 of 1616 feet, which also is roughly 1/201/20 of an inch. Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar calculations, Newton made his calculations very carefully and found a discrepancy so large that he regarded the theory as contradicted by facts, and did not publish his results. Six years later a new measurement of the size of the earth showed that the astronomers had been using an incorrect distance to the moon. When Newton heard of this, he made the calculation again, with the corrected figures, and obtained beautiful agreement.

Fig. 7–3.Apparatus for showing the independence of vertical and horizontal motions.

This idea that the moon “falls” is somewhat confusing, because, as you see, it does not come any _closer_. The idea is sufficiently interesting to merit further explanation: the moon falls in the sense that _it falls away from the straight line that it would pursue if there were no forces_. Let us take an example on the surface of the earth. An object released near the earth’s surface will fall 1616 feet in the first second. An object shot out _horizontally_ will also fall 1616 feet; even though it is moving horizontally, it still falls the same 1616 feet in the same time. Figure [7–3](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F3) shows an apparatus which demonstrates this. On the horizontal track is a ball which is going to be driven forward a little distance away. At the same height is a ball which is going to fall vertically, and there is an electrical switch arranged so that at the moment the first ball leaves the track, the second ball is released. That they come to the same depth at the same time is witnessed by the fact that they collide in midair. An object like a bullet, shot horizontally, might go a long way in one second—perhaps 20002000 feet—but it will still fall 1616 feet if it is aimed horizontally. What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster? Do not forget that the earth’s surface is curved. If we shoot it fast enough, then when it falls 1616 feet it may be at just the same height above the ground as it was before. How can that be? It still falls, but the earth curves away, so it falls “around” the earth. The question is, how far does it have to go in one second so that the earth is 1616 feet below the horizon? In Fig. [7–4](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F4) we see the earth with its 40004000-mile radius, and the tangential, straight line path that the bullet would take if there were no force. Now, if we use one of those wonderful theorems in geometry, which says that our tangent is the mean proportional between the two parts of the diameter cut by an equal chord, we see that the horizontal distance travelled is the mean proportional between the 1616 feet fallen and the 80008000-mile diameter of the earth. The square root of (16/5280)×8000(16/5280)×8000 comes out very close to 55 miles. Thus we see that if the bullet moves at 55 miles a second, it then will continue to fall toward the earth at the same rate of 1616 feet each second, but will never get any closer because the earth keeps curving away from it. Thus it was that Mr. Gagarin maintained himself in space while going 25,00025,000 miles around the earth at approximately 55 miles per second. (He took a little longer because he was a little higher.)

Fig. 7–4.Acceleration toward the center of a circular path. From plane geometry, x/S=(2R−S)/x≈2R/xx/S=(2R−S)/x≈2R/x, where RR is the radius of the earth, 40004000 miles; xx is the distance “travelled horizontally” in one second; and SS is the distance “fallen” in one second (1616 feet).

Any great discovery of a new law is useful only if we can take more out than we put in. Now, Newton _used_ the second and third of Kepler’s laws to deduce his law of gravitation. What did he _predict?_ First, his analysis of the moon’s motion was a prediction because it connected the falling of objects on the earth’s surface with that of the moon. Second, the question is, _is the orbit an ellipse?_ We shall see in a later chapter how it is possible to calculate the motion exactly, and indeed one can prove that it should be an ellipse,[3](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#footnote_3) so no extra fact is needed to explain Kepler’s _first_ law. Thus Newton made his first powerful prediction.

The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously understood. For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the tides, hitherto mysterious. The moon pulls the water up under it and makes the tides—people had thought of that before, but they were not as clever as Newton, and so they thought there ought to be only one tide during the day. The reasoning was that the moon pulls the water up under it, making a high tide and a low tide, and since the earth spins underneath, that makes the tide at one station go up and down every 2424 hours. Actually the tide goes up and down in 1212 hours. Another school of thought claimed that the high tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they argued, the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both of these theories are wrong. It actually works like this: the pull of the moon for the earth and for the water is “balanced” at the center. But the water which is closer to the moon is pulled _more_ than the average and the water which is farther away from it is pulled _less_ than the average. Furthermore, the water can flow while the more rigid earth cannot. The true picture is a combination of these two things.

![](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/img/FLP_I/f07-05/f07-05_tc_big.svgz)

Fig. 7–5.The earth-moon system, with tides.

What do we mean by “balanced”? What balances? If the moon pulls the whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the moon? Because the earth does the same trick as the moon, it goes in a circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center. The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both go around a central position, each falling toward this common position, as shown in Fig. [7–5](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F5). This motion around the common center is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in a straight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal force.” The result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the center of the earth. On the near side, the attraction from the moon is stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but again _away_ from the center of the earth. The net result is that we get _two_ tidal bulges.

### 7–5Universal gravitation

What else can we understand when we understand gravity? Everyone knows the earth is round. Why is the earth round? That is easy; it is due to gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not _exactly_ a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation.

What else can you do with the law of gravitation? If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were _ahead_ when Jupiter was particularly _close_ to the earth and they were _behind_ when Jupiter was _farther_ from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even in _one place_ where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to _see_ the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light. This was done in 1676.

If all of the planets pull on each other, the force which controls, let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun; there is also a pull from, say, Saturn. This force is not really strong, since the sun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is _some_ pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles” around the correct elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little more complicated. Attempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation. The effects of each of these planets on each other were calculated to see whether or not the tiny deviations and irregularities in these motions could be completely understood from this one law. Lo and behold, for Jupiter and Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was “weird.” It behaved in a very peculiar manner. It was not travelling in an exact ellipse, but that was understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn. But even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus _still_ was not going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being overturned, a possibility that could not be ruled out. Two men, Adams and Le Verrier, in England and France, independently, arrived at another possibility: perhaps there is _another_ planet, dark and invisible, which men had not seen. This planet, NN, could pull on Uranus. They calculated where such a planet would have to be in order to cause the observed perturbations. They sent messages to the respective observatories, saying, “Gentlemen, point your telescope to such and such a place, and you will see a new planet.” It often depends on with whom you are working as to whether they pay any attention to you or not. They did pay attention to Le Verrier; they looked, and there planet NN was! The other observatory then also looked very quickly in the next few days and saw it too.

Fig. 7–7.Orbit of Sirius B with respect to Sirius A.

This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solar system; but do they extend beyond the relatively small distances of the nearest planets? The first test lies in the question, do _stars_ attract _each other_ as well as planets? We have definite evidence that they do in the _double stars_. Figure [7–6](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F6) shows a double star—two stars very close together (there is also a third star in the picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned). The stars are also shown as they appeared several years later. We see that, relative to the “fixed” star, the axis of the pair has rotated, i.e., the two stars are going around each other. Do they rotate according to Newton’s laws? Careful measurements of the relative positions of one such double star system are shown in Fig. [7–7](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F7). There we see a beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all the way around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more). Everything coincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius A is _not at the focus_. Why should that be? Because the plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is viewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place. Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law.

Fig. 7–8.A globular star cluster.

That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indicated in Fig. [7–8](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F8). If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul. This figure shows one of the most beautiful things in the sky—a globular star cluster. All of the dots are stars. Although they look as if they are packed solid toward the center, that is due to the fallibility of our instruments. Actually, the distances between even the centermost stars are very great and they very rarely collide. There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as we move outward there are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is an attraction among these stars. It is clear that gravitation exists at these enormous dimensions, perhaps 100,000100,000 times the size of the solar system. Let us now go further, and look at an _entire galaxy_, shown in Fig. [7–9](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F9). The shape of this galaxy indicates an obvious tendency for its matter to agglomerate. Of course we cannot prove that the law here is precisely inverse square, only that there is still an attraction, at this enormous dimension, that holds the whole thing together. One may say, “Well, that is all very clever but why is it not just a ball?” Because it is _spinning_ and has _angular momentum_ which it cannot give up as it contracts; it must contract mostly in a plane. (Incidentally, if you are looking for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and what determines the shapes of these galaxies has not been worked out.) It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due to gravitation even though the complexities of its structure have not yet allowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scale of perhaps 50,00050,000 to 100,000100,000 light years. The earth’s distance from the sun is 813813 light _minutes_, so you can see how large these dimensions are.

Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated by Fig. [7–10](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F10), which shows many “little” things clustered together. This is a _cluster of galaxies_, just like a star cluster. Thus galaxies attract each other at such distances that they too are agglomerated into clusters. Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of _tens of millions_ of light years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to go out forever inversely as the square of the distance.

Fig. 7–11.An interstellar dust cloud.

Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of gravitation we can even get some ideas about the origin of the stars. If we have a big cloud of dust and gas, as indicated in Fig. [7–11](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F11), the gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another might make them form little lumps. Barely visible in the figure are “little” black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations of dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars. Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable. Figure [7–12](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F12) shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only 77 years later, which shows two new bright spots. Has gas accumulated, has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into a star? Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see _two!_

Fig. 7–13.A simplified diagram of the apparatus used by Cavendish to verify the law of universal gravitation for small objects and to measure the gravitational constant GG.

Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances. But if there is a force between _any_ pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple manner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured. It was first measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig. [7–13](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F13). This first demonstrated the direct force between two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately determine the coefficient GG in the formula

F=Gmm′r2.F=Gmm′r2.

All the masses and distances are known. You say, “We knew it already for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the _mass_ of the earth. By knowing GG from this experiment and by knowing how strongly the earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of the earth! This experiment has been called “weighing the earth” by some people, and it can be used to determine the coefficient GG of the gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be determined. GG turns out to be

6.670×10−11 newton⋅m2/kg2.6.670×10−11 newton⋅m2/kg2.

It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the effect on the history of science produced by this great success of the theory of gravitation. Compare the confusion, the lack of confidence, the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages, when there were endless debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicity of this law—this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a _simple rule_ to govern them, and further that man could _understand_ it and deduce how the planets should move! This is the reason for the success of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phenomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws.

### 7–7What is gravity?

But is this such a simple law? What about the machinery of it? All we have done is to describe _how_ the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said _what makes it go_. Newton made no hypotheses about this; he was satisfied to find _what_ it did without getting into the machinery of it. _No one has since given any machinery_. It is characteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstract character. The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quantities that have to be calculated and added together, with no mention of the machinery, and likewise the great laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws for which no machinery is available. Why can we use mathematics to describe nature without a mechanism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going because we find out more that way.

Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is interesting to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time. At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it, but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered about 1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they _are_ absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new consequences which are _not true_. This particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a _resistance to motion_ and would be slowing up in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work. No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without also predicting some other phenomenon that does _not_ exist.

Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other forces. There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces at the present time. It is not an aspect of electricity or anything like that, so we have no explanation. However, gravitation and other forces are very similar, and it is interesting to note analogies. For example, the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the square of the distance. It is in the opposite direction—likes repel. But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance? Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify them; the so-called unified field theory is only a very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation and electricity, the most interesting thing is the _relative strengths_ of the forces. Any theory that contains them both must also deduce how strong the gravity is.

Fig. 7–14.The relative strengths of electrical and gravitational interactions between two electrons.

If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons (nature’s universal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of two electrons due to their masses, we can measure the ratio of electrical repulsion to the gravitational attraction. The ratio is independent of the distance and is a fundamental constant of nature. The ratio is shown in Fig. [7–14](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch7-F14). The gravitational attraction relative to the electrical repulsion between two electrons is 11 divided by 4.17×10424.17×1042! The question is, where does such a large number come from? It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of the earth to the volume of a flea. We have considered two natural aspects of the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is a natural constant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day find the “universal equation,” and in it, one of the roots will be this number. It is very difficult to find an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we have to find _another_ large number somewhere. But do we mean the age of the universe in _years?_ No, because years are not “natural”; they were devised by men. As an example of something natural, let us consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10−2410−24 second. If we compare this time with the _age of the universe_, 2×10102×1010 years, the answer is 10−4210−42. It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe. If that were the case, the gravitational constant would change with time, because as the universe got older the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitational constant _is_ changing with time? Of course the changes would be so small that it is quite difficult to be sure.

One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been the effect of the change during the past 109109 years, which is approximately the age from the earliest life on the earth to now, and one-tenth of the age of the universe. In this time, the gravity constant would have increased by about 1010 percent. It turns out that if we consider the structure of the sun—the balance between the weight of its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generated inside it—we can deduce that if the gravity were 1010 percent stronger, the sun would be much more than 1010 percent brighter—by the _sixth power_ of the gravity constant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravity is changing, we find that the earth was then _closer in_. Altogether, the earth would be about 100100 degrees centigrade hotter, and all of the water would not have been in the sea, but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in the sea. So we do _not_ now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the age of the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed.

It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the _mass_, the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of _inertia_—of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a circle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of gravity, will stay together because to go in a circle _requires_ a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in _just the right proportion_ so that the two objects will go around together. If one object were inside the other it would _stay_ inside; it is a perfect balance. Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would find things “weightless” inside a space ship; if they happened to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the same way as the whole space ship, and so it would appear to remain suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this force is _exactly_ proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which inertia and weight would differ. The absence of such an effect has been checked with great accuracy by an experiment done first by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke. For all substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within 11 part in 1,000,000,0001,000,000,000, or less. This is a remarkable experiment.

### 7–8Gravity and relativity

Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modification of Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modified by Einstein to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at infinite speed. Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we _cannot send signals faster than the speed of light_, so the law of gravitation must be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into account, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has _energy_ has mass—mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed.

Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc. None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law modified to Einstein’s law can be further modified to be consistent with the uncertainty principle. This last modification has not yet been completed.
